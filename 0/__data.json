If you're looking to rent an apartment or know someone who needs one, you might find this post valuable. If you're settled, keep scrolling. :) I happen to have an apartment to rent in Mustam√§e - Ehitajate tee 40 (1st floor). Very close to TT√ú and Technopol, literally next to recently opened M√§nni park, and across the street from Mustam√§e Spa. It has 2 rooms laid out in 45.6m2. 1 bedroom, semi-open kitchen\u002Fliving area, nice bathroom, and a small functional entry. If you're looking for a place to rent and are able to get the smallest things done by yourself (e.g change the lightbulb) then let me know. Rent is 450‚Ç¨pm + utilities (50-60‚Ç¨ summer \u002F 100-140‚Ç¨ winter). Neighbors are decent and car(s) can be parked in front of the house.

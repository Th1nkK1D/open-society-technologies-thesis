					<p>Hi, ECA § 100 part 1 and 2 prescribes that upon cancellation of an employment contract due to lay-off, an employer shall pay an employee compensation to the extent of one month’s average wages of the employee and an employee has the right to receive a benefit upon lay-offs under the conditions and pursuant to the procedure prescribed in the Unemployment Insurance Act. ECA § 97 part 2 prescribes that an employer shall give an employee advance notice of extraordinary cancellation if the employee’s employment relationship with the employer has lasted: 1) less than one year of employment – no less than 15 calendar days; 2) one to five years of employment – no less than 30 calendar days; 3) five to ten years of employment – no less than 60 calendar days; 4) ten and more years of employment – no less than 90 calendar days. Does giving notice cancel the one month compensation? or vice-versa Or laying-off leads to notice time + compensation? duration of employment 1.5 years. Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>Tere! Hi there! I recently moved to Tallinn and thought about moving my freelance business status here too. Right now, I'm working via a freelance contract with my main client (remote employer basically, the Netherlands) and sometimes doing side work on the freelance markets.  I have the status of an Individual Entrepreneur in Armenia that has 0% tax (special condition for IT business) and something about 200 EUR per year of social fees. However, Armenian banking is not perfect, also the possibilities for using online payments in Armenia are kinda limited.  I was thinking of opening a business status here in Estonia, I checked FIE and OU statuses but as I see the tax rates are extremely… More</p></div>

I believe he is allowed to add a proportion of the rent [50%, for example] within the scope of the business expenses, correct? and if so, how it should be taxed, and what are the ramifications on the company itself and the employee in terms of the taxes/costs etc.? if someone can help, I would really appreciate it :)</p></div>

					<p>Hello, could you please advise how the vacation pay is calculated in Estonia? I mean, is the calculation done based on fix monthly salary written in the employment contract or it must be calculated based on total average monthly income in some period, where also additional bonuses are included?</p></div>

					<p>Hello there, I am writing you in regards to work done during bank holiday. I have a part time contract and I work usually 80-100 hours a month. in August I worked 10 hours on national holiday, 20th august, surprisingly though I haven't received any additional salary for that, I asked HR and they replied "we do not compensate double payment for part timers, only full timers get double pay on holiday", is that even legal? is there any specific law I should point HR at? thank you in advance</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone, How can i learn the tax rates for freelance work in Estonia? I want to have a projection for a year.  My company is willing to have a contract with me as a freelancer and a third party will deal with the issuing invoices (this is their agreed 3rd party) which means i won’t need to have a company. My company is operating outside of Estonia but the third party will have my payroll in Estonia.  But they said that they will pay me gross monthly and i need to take care of my taxes alone. Do you have any idea where can i get a better projection? (Even an online calculator would work, but each of them varies I couldn’t find a proper one) Thank you!!</p></div>

					<p>Hi guys! I will move to Estonia soon and I'm in the process of signing documents etc. I have got one question regarding "Tax free minimum amount" and I should choose if I want to get it calculated or not. On the government homepage I found some information and I understood that I'm not eligible because my gross salary will exceed the maximum amount for which this benefit is allowed. However, since I will be employed in July maybe they calculate the gross based on 6 months for 2022? In that case the total yearly gross/12  will be within the sum for being eligible. Did anyone have similar situation and could advise what is the best to choose? I would like to avoid to get some free amount and then to pay it back because of miscalculation. Thank you very much in advance!</p></div>

					<p>Hey fellow expats - need some advice if you are a professional contractor and a tax resident in Estonia. If you're working as a contractor (with a foreign company not in Estonia) what did you do about income tax? Did you work with an accountant?  Most common advice I hear is to create a Private limited company (OÜ) to invoice. It seems a bit complex (especially on how you need to split money to salary and dividends to get paid and not get screwed with %) I saw some services like xolo but they charge a tiered fee and have odd ways of doing thing. Would really appreciate if you can share your experience and what you did :)  Thanks a lot!</p></div>

					<p>Good afternoon! I moved to Estonia a few days ago and would like to start working again. Back in my country, I was what you call FIE here, but after finding out I'd lose 40% of my income to the taxes, my newcomer enthusiasm quickly disappeared. I looked at the previous posts and comments here and saw there's an option of OÜ, but I don't know much about it. So I'm looking for someone who could provide more detailed info about what is OÜ and if it's a viable option for me. Please let me know, thank you!</p></div>

					<p>Solved ======= Hello, is there a way to extract any kind of certificate proving the time i worked in Estonia?  In my home country it's a standard procedure to receive such a certificate on the last day of employment, but here i didn't get anything. I wonder what i should present to authorities to claim years that i worked in other EU country. Apparently there are no strict regulations on how it has to look like, but i guess it has to be precise in dates.  I bet there's some governmental website where it could be stated, but I have difficulties finding it. Help needed. I thougt about pay slips from bank account, but they don't state exact dates on what day exactly i started and finished working, so they are no good. Thank uu</p></div>

					<p>Hello, Is anyone having online job from a company located outside of Estonia? If yes, how do you pay taxes in Estonia (other than LHV entrepreneur account)? Because I knew that LHV entrepreneur account just takes 20% off from the income whether it is small or big, and if crossed the 25k annually mark, it goes to 40%. So, it is not the right account for income as social tax is not handled this way either.  Kindly contact me directly or write in the comments how do you do it.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone! I've searched the group for a few indications of accountants experienced with the establishment of FIE and OÜ, but the maximum I could find was one lost in a comment. I'm considering a move to Estonia and other EU countries, but since I work for different companies from different countries I'm still looking for the best tax match. I have read quite a bit about FIE, in the first place, but in order to make a decision, I'm certainly going to need some guidance. Any recommendation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance!</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone. I need some professional advice regards work visas, taxes, employment status. Below is a quick overview of my situation. If anyone here has experience with any consultants that could help me, please let me know.  Situation - I am a British national. Living in Tallinn with a residency permit. It is looking likely that I will get a new job with an EU company with no Estonian entity. As I do not have an EU passport, I am unsure of the best way to be employed by said company? From my limited understanding, I think the best option is for me to setup my own Estonian company and therefore be employed in Estonia.  If anyone has any experience with a similar situation then I would appreciate it.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone! I have a dormant company (OU) here in Estonia and I've been asked to submit an annual report. Through online research I've been able to complete it (almost) on my own but got stuck on two things. 1. What should be the labor cost? (no employees) 2. What do I choose on the 'proposal for distribution / covering loss' field? Hope you can shade some light on this. Thanks a lot 🙏</p></div>

					<p>My new employer says that I can apply for basic exemption. Can someone explain very simply to me what that means? What are the pro’s and con’s or advantages/disadvantages of applying for basic exemption?  Does exemption mean I don’t need to pay tax at all? Will that come around and bite me in the ass later on? If I become unemployed later on will that mean I don’t qualify for any benefits?  I have read this page and I still don’t quite understand. Please explain to me like I’m 5 years old 😅 thanks</p></div>

They mention that I’m not a a taxable resident in Estonia (move in in October got residence in November) and they ask me to declare my previous income in Italy to be taxed here. But I did already paid income taxes in Italy higher then here and I don’t see the reason to declare it here. Can I avoid to do it?</p></div>

					<p>Dear Group, I can always count on your help 🙏 🐝 this time I am looking for an accountant as I opened my own OU. The job will be simple because I will not have many invoices. The truth is I don’t speak Estonian and I may have more questions at the beginning to learn the process but we may agree for a different price for the first month accounting + consultancy. Thank you for recommendations of free mind accountants (cool people) who speak English and don’t mind working with foreigners. 🙏🤞🌎</p></div>

					<p>Question for those who are Estonian tax residence and hold US REITs through their Estonian investment account: Do you pay the taxes on those dividends to the US IRS or the Estonian tax board? The LHV broker that I spoke to said that we pay the Estonian tax board, but the info that I found on the web states that US REITs dividends are subject to US taxes regardless of whether foreigners own it. 😐 Can anyone recommend an English speaking tax consultant in this field?</p></div>

For a 2 rooms flat for a single person, what impact could that have on the bills?

					<p>&lt;Issuing invoices question>  Hi! I work part-time in a school in Tallinn, so they pay for my social tax and so on and I'm a tax resident in Estonia. I have the possibility to also teach some hours in an online language school based in Spain, but they need me to create an invoice. What options do I have? I have checked OÜ, FIE and the entrepreneur account in LHV but the cost is quite high for the benefit (less than 500 gross) and in LHV I am not able to issue an invoice. Is there any way I could issue an invoice without any of these for this small amount? Thank you all!</p></div>

					<p>Hi guys I’d like to start English speaking fitness classes in Kristiine district and make a little marketing research. Workout classes are aimed: - mobility &amp; flexibility - pain relief class (back, neck, shoulder, knee pain) The question is (if you’d be my potential client): 1) is it suitable for you to attend class at 10-11 am? 2) is it suitable to attend at 8-9 am? Actually what time is better in your opinion? 3) do you find Kristiine keskus area easy reachable for you? 4) is it ok for you if a fitness studio doesn’t have a shower?</p></div>

					<p>Hey everyone! I'm in search for a gym partner that we can train together and help each other out to meet our fitness goals (Goal set to be reached by mid april 2023). I've trained in previous years by myself most times and it's great. This time i'm looking for accountability - someone to keep me in check while I could provide the same to them if they wish so, because recently and on different occasions, I found myself diving in my work and studies very often  and dismissed the allocated time to train.  Here's the catch - I'm training at 4.30 am at Gym! Vanalinn. Won't find many people in the gym at that time. And the afternoon - evening can be verypacked.  On that note, anyone interested by any chance?</p></div>

					<p>Tere 👋  I’m looking for a personal trainer to help me to create a workout plan for me. Do you have any recommendations?  I would love to hear more about your experience and how you were able to achieve your goals?  Thanks I’m advance</p></div>

					<p>Spend only 1-2h of your week with me and you will have better health for upcoming life and your productivity at work will increase. What ever your goal is - we will achieve it together. Don't believe me? I think you already do, but you are afraid to take that step. So now you know what you SHOULD do- contact me and book personal training in Gym! clubs (Vanalinn, Ülemiste, Rotermanni). Available times: Mornings (7-8), Lunch Time ( Vanalinn 12-13 or 13-14) and After Work ( 17.30-...)   You are only one step away - choose your road and let's start!</p></div>

					<p>For those interested in personal training. Call to arms. Firstly, thanks to all who already closed deals. We got a good thing going! For the rest, I am offering a chance to get acquainted with personal training in Tallinn with modest costs. There are few places in my calendar that could still be filled with exercise!  I'm enrolled on a Scandinavian FAF-PT course. I look for several people to train along Feb-Apr at gym or outside. We can also discuss nutrition and weight control. If you have spark to get in shape before the beautiful Estonian summer sets in drop me a few lines in private and we'll see what we can do. At the moment, I am asking for reimbursement of my own gym costs and my weekly fish catch. You can contact me in English, Finnish or Estonian. In the future I am looking for a few regulars to engage on a more long-term life change plan and in building a better you.</p></div>

					<p>Tere!  I will be arriving in Tallinn next week and wanted to inquire about the workout scene in the city. What gyms do you guys recommend for expats/foreigners (i.e where there's more diversity)? I don't really care about too much except that the gym should be clean, have a decent powerlifting rack/weights, dedicated bench presses, lockers and be closer to the city center/Kadriorg.  Also any unspoken rules I should be aware of? For example, here in the US it's heavily frowned upon to take up a rack if you're on your phone for a majority of the time, not racking your weights after you're done etc.  Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>Anyone planning to have a driving exam in the next few weeks and would like to pass it sooner? I have my exam scheduled on the 16th of November but I need to reschedule for later as I will be abroad that day. We can exchange the exam dates, I'll free mine so you can take it and then I take yours. The end of November or any day in December is fine for me. Edit: Thanks for the suggestions!</p></div>

					<p>A English speaking friend of mine wants to take driving lessons here in Estonia. She has nobody to teach her, and has no driving experience. What is her best course of action to get driving lessons from a professional, friendly, English speaking teacher/school? Cost is also something she takes into account, so she doesn't need anything ultra premium, but she would like it to be a good teacher/school. A good environment to learn. Any suggestions on how to go about it? Also, what would be the typical cost from beginning to end of the entire education until taking a test?</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone, I am planning to do an A2 or A motorcycle license in Estonia and I would like to know if there are any driving schools in Tallinn that offer classes in English? Further, what is the average price range of such a license? So if you have any recommendations based on personal experience, feel free to share.  Also, how are the regulations with the theory classes if I already own a driving permit class B for over 3 years? Do I have to redo all of theory classes or just a few ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù ones?

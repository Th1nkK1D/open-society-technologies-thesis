Russia denies Ukraine as an independent country, Russia denies Ukrainians as a nation. I believe many of you have friends, colleagues, neighbors or classmates who are Ukrainians. I hope Ukrainians showed you what beatiful, positive, smart and hospitable people we are with authentic culture, own history and big hearts.

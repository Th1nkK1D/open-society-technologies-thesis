					<p>Hey guys, looking for a friend female or male it does not matter. Im a male 27 years old, living in Tallinn. I’m studying web development and I graduated with a computer science degree. I speak English fluently and would be interested in learning Estonian. It would be nice if I could meet someone genuine, educated and ambitious. I like to go on walks, play video games, watch thriller series/movies and try new activities. If you are interested in being friends and hangout possibly let me know. Have a wonderful day!</p></div>

					<p>👀 looking for a shared home  👀 Hi everyone :) I’m searching for a room in a shared flat from November/December. I’m 26 years old, from Germany and will relocate to Tallinn to start a little adventure and work as a web developer at a local company. For the last 7 years I have solely lived in shared flats and I always enjoyed it, so I was hoping to find some friendly people here looking for a flatmate. Apart from work, I enjoy playing my guitar, reading books, cooking, or going out to exhibitions and concerts. When it comes to living together, I enjoy a friendly and open minded community and I always value spending time together like cooking together, having a drink or going out. If you know anything, please feel free to contact me via DM 🐥</p></div>

					<p>Hey there, we think about relocating from Germany to Tallinn and would love to talk to some expats living there to get a better picture. Is there anybody here in this group open to have a little video chat? Or maybe also to meet up for a coffee in Tallinn in mid-October? (We are just planning a trip.) We are Jana, Andreas and our 1,5 years old son and our dog - so input on family life and how dog friendly the city is would be appreciated as well. Also feel free to leave a comment or DM me if that suits you better. Any tipps are welcome. Thank you!</p></div>

					<p>Up for drinks with 10-14 other expats, and 1-2 Estonians? We're meeting EVERY EVENING 19.30 at some great pubs and restaurants. Don't worry about being late - we've never left before the place closes :D  Definitely let me know if you'd be interested, and I can add you to our chat as well 😉 Why do it? I've got a lot of free time as I'm writing my thesis. But also, as an Estonian I've just had a lot of fun organising the meetups and met some super interesting people from diverse backgrounds.  Having up to 14 people has enabled everyone to mingle. It also allows having daily meetups. Thus, you can always let me know when you have a free evening and would like to just hang out.  Cheers 🙂</p></div>

					<p>Up for drinks with 8-9 other expats, and 1-2 Estonians? We're meeting Thursday (tonight) and Saturday 19.30 at Hell Hunt. Don't worry about being late. Definitely let me know if you'd be interested and I can add you to our chat as well ;) Why do it? Firstly, I've got a lot of free time as I'm writing my thesis. But also, as an Estonian I've just had a lot of fun organising five great meetups in the past couple weeks. Having up to 10 people enables everyone to mingle, so I'd like to continue with that format. It also allows having more meetups, compared to larger networking events that are great but often take place only once a month. Cheers :)</p></div>

					<p>Dear fellow expats, With regards to the Nordkapp expedition I was thinking Aug 8 Monday. We need also to create a separate group/chat to discuss it further and schedule a face to face meeting before the scheduled trip so we discuss everything in detail. What do u think? Feel free to comment and we need to assign a leader.  Regardless I will proceed anyway with or without company.</p></div>

					<p>Hey guys, I was wondering if the group have any expat meetups planned or if there are some meetups taking place in Tallinn on a regular basis? I visited a couple of times and did get to know this retired American gentleman who moved there from the US last year, while he may be young at heart he is not very tech-savvy and he has not managed to understand Facebook or open an Estonian bank account for example. He also can’t get PayPal to work and is stressed out about owing me 70 euros after a night out drinking although I constantly reassure him that it is no problem and I don’t worry at all but you know, that generation…. I think it would help him a lot to get to know other expats in the kind of ”where are y’all from what can we help each other with?” setting that I imagine such meetups being. So, any tips?  Facebook links are good, I will just convert them to the necessary format of venue name, street address, date and time and then text them to him like you do with old people 😁</p></div>

I am very new to the city, and I'd be super happy to connect with like-minded individuals. 😊 Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>Hi there :D  I've just created a group for people living in Tallinn and fans of pop culture (LOTR, Star Wars, back to the future, etc...), music, and gaming. The goal is to share some memes about our life in Tallinn, talk and meet new people which have the same interests, maybe organize some chill events :D   For example, you're looking for other players of your multiplayer game? You can ask it here!  You wanna go for a walk with other geeks? Yep, the place to be.  You wanna share that awesome Anakin meme? Let's go!   Here is the link of the group :D The fellowship of Tallinn - Memes, chatting, social events</p></div>

					<p>Hey expats, I am moving to Tallinn today, and I need some help... making new friends. I lived in 7 countries so far, and had no problems with it, but now the thing is I have my own gig and don't have a specific program, studies or company to guide me through socialization. Has any of you been in a similar situation? If you have any ideas, want to meet up for coffee with other expats, please let me know! Truly feels a bit awkward asking, but I'm gonna miss some social interactions during winter months :)</p></div>

					<p>*Recruiting summer friends* 😂  Ok- now that I caught your attention, the above statement is kinda true haha 🙂 I have a  group of friends in Tallinn but we’d like to meet more people and sometimes is hard (I mean the past 2 years have been very crazy due to our current global situation). Anyway, if you’d like to meet a cool bunch (mostly foreigners but some Estonians as well) send me a dm 🙂 we usually organize dinners together, on the summer go to Noblesseneri, events, watch the sunset, make bbq etc.  Our age group is mid twenties to mid-late thirties. Many bonus points if you are a girl. 🤗 You may ask: “Why summer if we are still on winter?”  Well… you can’t make friends overnight (I mean sometimes we do) haha but- it will give us room to create enough bonding and if it can survive until the summer, then the mission is accomplished. 😂</p></div>

					<p>Good morning! ❄️☀️ Hope you are enjoying the crisp weather (if not, well, the summer comes every year, at least so far!).  If you want to meet new people, both Estonians and other nationalities, Estonian Refugee Council is looking for volunteers.  The activities vary a lot (from being a language buddy to help organize cultural events or if you have any specific skill you think might be useful - let us know!).  Last autumn we made the video below (first test - if you like it, contact us! :D). More information: https://www.pagulasabi.ee/en/volunteer-us or anu@pagulasabi.ee Looking forward to meet you! :)</p></div>

Anyway, if you’d like to meet a cool bunch (mostly foreigners but some Estonians as well) send me a dm 🙂 we usually organize dinners together, on the summer go to Noblesseneri, events, watch the sunset, make bbq etc.  Our age group is mid twenties to mid-late thirties. Many bonus points if you are a girl. 🤗 You may ask: “Why summer if we are still on winter?”  Well… you can’t make friends overnight (I mean sometimes we do) haha but- it will give us room to create enough bonding and if it can survive until the summer, then the mission is accomplished. 😂",timestamp:new Date(1642033512000),topicId:19,sentiment:"Positive",topicConfidence:1,sentimentConfidence:.83},{text:"Good morning! ❄️☀️ Hope you are enjoying the crisp weather (if not, well, the summer comes every year, at least so far!).

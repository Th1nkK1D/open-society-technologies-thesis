Thank you for your help everyone! I‚Äôm really overwhelmed and thankful with the response and willingness to help ‚ù§Ô∏è Hi everyone! I am in urgent need of finding one of the following: Baneocin (Baltic countries, Russia?) Known equivalents: Neosporin (USA, no prescription needed)  ^ Update: Sold in India as well.  Bactroban (Ireland, prescription status unknown) Dermisone Tri Antibiotica (Spain, no prescription needed) We were prescribed Baneocin for my infant son‚Äôs post surgical care, which is the only thing that seems to work (Braunovidon isn‚Äôt helping), but no pharmacy in Estonia has it, and apparently it‚Äôs been backlogged from the supplier for months now. We used the last of a tube a friend gave us a few days ago and are unable to find anything else that works here.  If anyone by any chance has a tube of anything on the list and is willing to sell it, or is coming back from any of those countries in the next few days and can get it for me, please contact me.

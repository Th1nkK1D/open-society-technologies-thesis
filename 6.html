					<p>Hey folks! I am starting to bring back Sofar Sounds to Tallinn. Sofar Sounds are live discovery shows that are meant to bring music lovers and 3 artists together in an intimate small venue setting üé§ https://www.sofarsounds.com/ You can check out YouTube videos of Sofar for a better picture of what is is - you can find a ton of these from hundreds of different cities. So, to the point. I am looking for volunteer (yes, it‚Äôs self-funded and so it‚Äôs not a paid job) photographers, video production people, and a sound engineer (someone who also is capable of recording audio at a live concert would be amazing).  This would be an awesome side project for someone who loves and appreciates music. I understand that it is not a paid job, so by no means I am looking for absolute professionals. If you are a student and need practice, this could be a great opportunity, for instance. So, if you want to help with photography, video or sound, please feel free to reach out to me! üé∂</p></div>

					<p>Hi, I was wondering how or where you make musician friends. I've been here for over two months, and I haven't met anyone who listens to (most of) the same music as mine other than my roomie. The musicians I know from my dorm/uni mainly just listen to and play anime/video game music, EDM, hard rock, or rap music. I enjoy listening to artists like Alicia Keys, Evanescence, Fall Out Boy, Rihanna, and Paramore- what I listen to depends on my mood, but yeah, I hope to meet people I could jam with (I was a vocalist/rhythm guitarist forever ago)... maybe even do karaoke with. ü•πüôèüèª</p></div>

					<p>Dear everyone, Did you ever wonder how would your life sound in a song? If you are curious, I'd like to offer you my songwriting and musician skills to make a song out of you and your life experience!  Shortly about me: I'm a musician and songwriter with over 10 years of experience. I know different genres and mostly play guitar. You can check my fb band page to get the idea: https://facebook.com/104991172058257/a I write mostly about myself and the world around me. It's a lot of fun but now I would like to try writing songs from other people's perspectives.  What I offer is a 3-4 minute song made with acoustic guitar and my voice (or your voice, if you want to sing), recorded in a semi‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>Been running a music record label and collective back home since 7+ years. I've been wondering if there's any music collective here in Estonia? Or any folks who are into music and would be interested to meet up - I am interested in understanding the local music scene in Estonia and the Baltics - mainly the business side.  It would be great if anyone knows someone to connect with or is part of this group and would love to connect. Feel free to DM. Cheers!</p></div>

					<p>Last October I learnt about the concert that Sparks would do here in Tallinn. I couldn't be happier, but still not believing that these guys would give a concert here when they're not known by the majority of people despite their geniality, long career and massive influence in the world of music with so many famous bands and musicians being largely influenced by them... With all this being said, and so excited knowing the ultimate day it's finally 2 weeks away, I wonder who might be the others 'suburban homeboys weirdos' here coming to this concert? Anyone? :D</p></div>

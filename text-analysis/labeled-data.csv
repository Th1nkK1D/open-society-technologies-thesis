"Question/Discussion: Why are Estonians against saying thank you? (my brosther in law being an example) I'm British and we have a compulsion towards saying please and thankyou, and of course sorry allot. Manners are different here, of course, but im curious to hear why being polite, saying please, thakyou or exhibiting humility and a gentle manner is rejected or actively avoided? Maybe the polite form is constructed inside gramar instead of a specific word used, like spanish or itallian has polite forms of ""you"" when speaking to those you dont know yet or older people etc.  It might be a resistance to see onself as a servent or subservient? But I feel saying please and thankyou recognises the free will of someone, in the sense that they are not obliged to do anything therefore one recognises their act as one made out of free will to assist and to show you are greatfull and not so egoistic as to expect service without any question.

"What would you advise and where can I report this? My previous apartment had a deposit sum paid to the owner in cash. The contract particularly stated cash payment. We never had any problems.

There's also messaging about 18-20th of every month, when she comes to get her money - ""I am coming"", ""I am here"", every month.  On the last day of my stay in the apartment, we got into an argument. She denied having my deposit. She claimed the second month was not paid so it was the month in which my deposit was expended. At last she agreed to pay me a balance after the utility bills had been received and deducted from my deposit sum. We signed each others written statement and took pictures.

"Hello there! My husband and I just arrived here in Tallinn last Friday, and we're looking for an apartment for renting long term. We have a budget of up to 500/600 euro including expenses, or so. We're currently staying at an airbnb in Pelguranna. We booked here until Nov 11, but our landlady was very kind with us, and she agreed to extend our stay until Nov 24 if necessary. So that'd be our deadline for moving. We're not looking for anything fancy, obviously. Essentially, it has to be in Tallinn, one or two rooms, and it has to be cozy lol We speak English, Spanish, some Armenian, but sadly no Estonian yet.

The workshops are housed in the small, 15th- to 17th-century rooms on the south side of the lane, and are set up in an open-studio fashion so visitors can watch the artists at work, be it glass-blowing, weaving or pottery making.

Right now it's cheaper than what I had and Eesti Energia has moved me to the new service, but while I have a fixed price, the universal service is not fixed. That means that it could sky rocket and I could be paying double or triple than before.  Also, with the ""green"" package theoretically all my electricity should come from green sources but according to the Eesti Energia page all the electricity produced for the universal energy price comes from oil shale which is far from green. Probably there is something I do not understand here and I'm overthinking (what a surprise) but something feels off. Is there anyone around here that knows better and can resolve my doubts?

His pop art was the purest, the sharpest, the wittiest ‚Äì both the most direct and the most confusing.

The water out of your tab should be at least 50 but not more than 60 degrees. Also you can safe further if you don't let it heat all day. Depending on the size of the boiler, the amount of water you are using and current price you can unplug it over the day and let it heat over the night. The boiler can easily keep the temperature. For the more ambitious people: I plugged the boiler to a smart switch which is connected with the smart home.

Whether or not the place is off limits, is a rather grey area, one thing is for certain though - the roads leading there have rocks bigger than my.... anyway, if you really want to visit, do it discreetly, and I would recommend not using your car or motorbike, unless you don't mind huge stones damaging your vehicle.",9,7,1662573714000,NA,tallinn - estonia - day - people - sold - food - expat - wa - estonian - friend,Neutral

I went to a random repair service, and got infor that ordering necessary details would round up in 200‚Ç¨+service costs because the supply chain for this model is modest in Estonia according to the staff. Given that I‚Äôm tight on budget rn, I still hope to mb find another  repair service (I tend to try different place cuz mb they have different supply chains, and mb I‚Äôm lucky). I travel to Riga and Poland from time to time, so I‚Äôm willing to wait longer if the repair there in total is in my budget aka less than 200‚Ç¨.  Thanks in advance.",7,8,1657271667000,21_iphone_monitor_laptop_screen,iphone - monitor - laptop - screen - pro - mac - inch - macbook - keyboard - core,Neutral

"*Travel advice* It seems the airports are jam-packed across the europe. Probably due to the Covid relaxations and summer. Make sure you arrive at the airports a bit earlier than usual. Also if you have connection flight, make sure you have enough time between flights.  I transited through Brussels and Amsterdam airports yesterday.  I had a connection flight in Brussels but I missed it because the queue at the passport control was huuuge and I couldn't make it to the flight.  I had 1 hour 20 mins between my previous flight and connection flight but that wasn't enough.  So I took a train to Amsterdam to catch another flight. This time I arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the scheduled time and that was just enough!

I will move to Estonia soon and I'm in the process of signing documents etc. I have got one question regarding ""Tax free minimum amount"" and I should choose if I want to get it calculated or not. On the government homepage I found some information and I understood that I'm not eligible because my gross salary will exceed the maximum amount for which this benefit is allowed. However, since I will be employed in July maybe they calculate the gross based on 6 months for 2022? In that case the total yearly gross/12  will be within the sum for being eligible. Did anyone have similar situation and could advise what is the best to choose? I would like to avoid to get some free amount and then to pay it back because of miscalculation.

Erik is passionate about business, music and self-development, he also loves to talk about polemic topics from different perspectives and learn from other's experiences, he is an out-of-the-box thinker, even when it can bring some bad faces around him, but that is the ""spicy touch"" he likes to have in life.  Promoting his home country around the globe is something very important for Erik, same as defending equality and justice for those who need it.""

Long story short, a very dear friend got a job there, but it seems that it is easier to win the lottery than find a place to live.

"Interesting initiative has emerged in form of a Bench Day/ Pingip√§ev (May 22). Usually we treat streets as ways of getting to somewhere. And often we don't pay attention what's the space around you actually looking like. So everyone is encouraged to pick up a chair or bench and to go out on your home street for a few hours. You could just see the time pass by or do some people watching. Alternatively you can read a book, ask a neighbor to join you for a board game, have lunch out, play an instrument or you name it. So let's celebrate the benches around our streets and neighborhoods.",5,21,1653112991000,NA,tallinn - estonia - day - people - sold - food - expat - wa - estonian - friend,Positive
"Hello expat friends: I was wondering if there is or every has been a regular polyglot gathering in Tallinn? That is to say where people meet together at a cafe, and practice all the different language ages they would like to practice with the other participants?  I attended one of these in San Francisco many years ago and it was such fun! There was a sign on each table at the cafe stating which language was spoken at that table, and people would rotate among the tables of the languages they wanted to practice.  Has anything like that ever taken place here in Tallinn? And if not, would you be interested in attending one if it existed?",5,21,1653097629000,NA,tallinn - estonia - day - people - sold - food - expat - wa - estonian - friend,Positive

Hey fellow expats - need some advice if you are a professional contractor and a tax resident in Estonia. If you're working as a contractor (with a foreign company not in Estonia) what did you do about income tax? Did you work with an accountant?  Most common advice I hear is to create a Private limited company (O√ú) to invoice. It seems a bit complex (especially on how you need to split money to salary and dividends to get paid and not get screwed with %) I saw some services like xolo but they charge a tiered fee and have odd ways of doing thing. Would really appreciate if you can share your experience and what you did :)  Thanks a lot!,5,18,1652880391000,9_tax_accountant_income_pay,tax - accountant - income - pay - company - invoice - employee - accounting - freelance - taxation,Positive

"I don't post too often in Facebook groups, but I have something exciting to share. I am starting a new Podcast series called Expat Life which will explore all areas of living as an expat. Not just in Estonia, but overall.  If you have experience in living abroad, which most of you here do, and if you'd like to be my guest to share your story then I'd love to hear from you. The goal is to share with the audience what are the kind of struggles we have faced and how we've overcome them to help people be prepared. A bit about me: I'm from Estonia, moved away at 16, lived in Ireland, United Kingdom, Canada, a few months in Kuala Lumpur and two years as a digital nomad here there and everywhere. In October last year I decided to relocate back to Estonia after half my life abroad.  I also spent the last 10 years working for various companies providing relocation and moving services globally.

"Dear expats in Tallinn, we would like to know your opinion! üßê Tallinn City Government announced last week that they will create a small square in the middle of the Lembitu park in honor of Ukraine. While this is a needed gesture, it does not serve the original point of renaming the streets in front of Russian embassies across Europe. Yes, in Tallinn, the embassy is located in the historical Old Town. The  City of Tallinn has a naming committee too, which has not supported renaming the whole Pikk street. But we think, that renaming just the 22 meter street section in front of the Russian Embassy would be a compromise that should be considered. Just to be clear - this petition ‚ùå has nothing to do  ‚ùåwith renaming ancient streets. Just the specific section in front of the Russian Embassy. Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Albania all have done so. Just to make a statement to the local staff of the Russian Embassy. And of course, to Kremlin, who despises such actions.

"Dear expats in Tallinn, we would like to know your opinion! üßê Tallinn City Government announced this week that they will create a small square in the middle of the Lembitu park in honor of Ukraine. While this is a needed gesture, it does not serve the original point of renaming the streets in front of Russian embassies across Europe. Yes, in Tallinn, the embassy is located in the historical Old Town. The  City of Tallinn has a naming committee too, which has not supported renaming the whole Pikk street. But we think, that renaming just the 22 meter street section in front of the Russian Embassy would be a compromise that should be considered. Just to be clear - this petition ‚ùå has nothing to do  ‚ùåwith renaming ancient streets. Just the specific section in front of the Russian Embassy. Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Albania all have done so. Just to make a statement to the local staff of the Russian Embassy. And of course, to Kremlin, who despises such actions.

Potential clients are Russian citizens opposed to the Russian aggression against Ukraine (of course - why else would they have moved here?), who are currently living in Estonia based on short-term (1 year, non-renewable) work visa, who work in a large international US and EU-headquartered IT/software company with an office/legal entity in Tallinn. One of them had just recently received a refusal from PPA of their temp residence permit application (on the ground of recently added sanctions in Estonia). Any contacts suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

"Hello fellow expats, in the last few weeks my wife and I have been hosting a Ukrainian woman and her 12 years old daughter. They recently escaped to Estonia, received the 1 year protection status, and Oksana is now looking for a job.

Oksana is a lawyer with experience in civil law, family law, corporate law, and the registration of legal entities.

I‚Äôve contacted several Estonian start-ups but they either have extremely big number of emails in their inbox or just not looking for the candidates at this point. I do speak three languages fluently (Russian, Estonian, English) and have experience of working in different fields.

"Dear Movie Enthusiasts! Estonian cinemas have an increasing issue, that animated films only screen Estonian and Russian dubs, making it impossible for English-speaking people in Estonia to enjoy animated films in cinemas. Same for just people who want to experience it with performances by the original cast. I've spoken to all Estonian cinema chains on the subject. The problem is cited as lack of audience interest for English screenings, which I think is not fully the case, as these English screenings are once-in-a-blue-moon occurrences and are very hard to catch, if there even is one (quite a lot don't even have a single showing).  There are 3 English screenings of ""Turning Red"" at Coca-Cola plaza, by Forum Cinemas over the weekend so if you're interested, it's a good chance to catch a screening with the original cast and also to show that there is a demand for English screenings.",3,18,1647604713000,30_film_movie_screening_cinema,film - movie - screening - cinema - prus - kino - posti - watch - volunteer - short,Neutral

Respect people regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, and their sexual and cultural background.  As some pointed out below, pro-feminist, LGBTIQ+, anti-war and pro-democracy protests are technically not tolerated by the authorities in Russia.

"Hello, I just relocated to Estonia from St Petersburg yesterday. I have 2 sputnik vaccines but need to get a booster shot and hopefully a qr code. Hopefully someone can help out: 1) maybe other Russians here know if the gososlugi printed off qr codes work (I know they don't scan properly but curious if places accept it). I have this 'green pass' I got from Euromed too, but it's qr code won't work either. 2) it's clear on the official website that the vaccines are for people living in Estonia. I'm American, and our embassies dont give out vaccines for some dumb reason. I've heard from people that I can still get it though, curious if anyone has done it. I don't have residency or visas for EU yet, just normal America entry visa at the moment. I saw that I could also do it in Croatia or Turkey but I would prefer to not have to travel more. I only need the booster shot and I even had my 2nd covid case 2 months ago (so I think doing a full cycle is probably not a good idea, and unfortunately no documents to support this incident) Thanks!",3,3,1646319722000,35_covid_vaccine_vaccination_booster,covid - vaccine - vaccination - booster - certificate - vaccinated - shot - dos - qr - eu,Negative
"As watching today the press conference the important thing that stood out is that we need to stand together and protect our people, our country.  The ministers talked that we shouldn't hurt residents in our country who have emigrated from other countries, especially russians, and of course other foreign nationals. We are an understanding, caring nation and country. Let's hold our people and care for them more and more everyday. We know that the war isn't against russians but the president of Russia. Also, our own people should think if it's reasonable to go to another country's territory and start fighting because we don't want the same thing happening in our own territory, especially when Estonia will be represented out in the open amongst ourselves. Estonian government won't be able to help you when you get hurt or even if you'll get taken as prisoners there.

"We want to terminate a residential lease contract 2 months before its end (we told our landlord that we want to move out in two or three weeks). First, because the new utility bill is incredibly high (500‚Ç¨ instead of 200‚Ç¨), second, because our salary got reduced by 30%, so we can't afford the apartment anymore. There's another reason though: we decided to live in two different apartments with my girlfriend instead of this one.  The landlord doesn't want to return the safety deposit only because we want to terminate it earlier, he thinks he's allowed to have a compensation for that. Although in the contract the reasons for not returning the deposit are those regarding the damages of the property, not a word about compensation for early termination. In the contract it says that any side can terminate the contract for a good reason without any time for a warning. Can our reasons be considered as good reasons by Estonian law of obligations?

"Hi all Here's a PSA and a conversation starter regarding unfair treatment by the police: Expat friends of mine got detained by the police recently for smoking marijuana by the sea. Although the amount was very little (Less than 1g per person), they were treated like dangerous criminals: Their hands got handcuffed behind their back, they got sent to the police station to be detained for hours, threatened with phrases like ""Do you want to be sent back home?"", made to give urine samples for testing, made to take off their jackets and shoes outside under snow for searching them and in the end got each served with hundreds of Euros in fine while they could've easily gotten a written warning and let go (According to google, that's what usually happens here with small amounts and first offence, which was the exact situation) What would you do in this situation? Should they appeal to the fines? Report the police regarding the unfair treatment?

"Hi guys, I signed a contract with Telia for home internet a week ago. Unfortunately, after connecting the router and modem I have no internet connection. The wifi network is visible, but after connecting to it I have no internet.  The landlord told me that the previous tenant had internet at Elisa and maybe something is wrong because of that. I wrote on Telia chat then they asked me to make an appointment to talk to a technician. The technician called to me and told to do the things I did before contacting them, i.e. unplugged the modem, unplugged the cables, swapped them around, but nothing. The technician also did not conjure up anything from the phone :(  I am poor at technical matters, and I care about having access to the Internet asap. My point is that I made an appointment with the technician on Thursday to come and see what's going on (earlier hours like 14-16 didn't suited me) But maybe someone has time today or during the week evening hours to take a look and try to fix it?

"Guys, please talk to me about Pringi, Viimsi. We spent lovely couple of weeks there this summer but now my husband went there again and came back almost depressed. He said the area is dark, unkempt, unwelcoming, no snow ploughs, and because of that the roads and paths are very narrow... So, overall, his impression is that it is a summer cottage area, not really developed yet to the level of year round living, especially with young kids. And that to live there one would need some snow removal machinery, too, or SUVs or what not... Of course we weren't expecting Pirita level there but what he is telling now is a bit too disappointing for me, too. But I know there are people living there, including year round! What are your impressions, observations, coping techniques or what nots? And one more thing: what about internet and mobile connection there? in the summer we had just our phones with roaming and a local Zen prepaid sim-card, and it was a total disaster.

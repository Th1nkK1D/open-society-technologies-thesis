I understand that the previous years, people did not really care, but this year everybody is worrying about the price and the reserves of gas. So why should the temperature in the Malls and super markets be around 26-27 degrees and why should it be that warm so the employees wear short sleeve t-shirts while they are working. Needless to say that this temperature is unbearable for people who come in the stores from outside. Don't let me start about the temperature in the apartments/working spaces. There is absolutely no need for a blanket or even a sweater. Any thoughts? Or is it just me? 🤔\",\n",
       " 'Pretty wintry weather is having a meltdown quite literally. Temperature is on the plus side and the fluffy snow is melting and turning to ice.  So here’s a short guide to survive:  🤕 sticks or signs on the sidewalks mean that you should avoid walking on the sidewalk because of the possible falling ice. Always look up when the snow is melting! \\U0001fa7c shiny and dark pavements are usually very slippery due to ice. Walk like a penguin 🐧 to avoid falling. 🏊\\u200d♀️ keep your feet dry with wellies. 🚑 when you’ve taken a bad fall, the number of emergency services is 112. You’ll find emergency care at a hospital on Ravi street 18 in central Tallinn or Sütiste tee 19 in Mustamäe district.',\n",
       " 'If you’re suffering from slippery ice (and it will get worse!) the solution is a set of removable ICE CLEATS! Go get some! These are metal spikes that you stretch over the sole of your shoes. When you walk, the spikes bite into the ice and provide grip. Below are some photos. Cheap cleats like in the first two pics last one winter or less. These ones used to be pointed this time last year and have worn down. Every time you step on concrete not ice they’ll wear off, so it’s especially bad in March where everything’s melting and it’s ice - street - ice. You can get these sort of cleats for under €20 at some shoe shops and at Prisma (not Selver, and no idea about Rimi.) The second are a set I… More',\n",

Unfortunately, the one we use for our boy requires the the child sleeps for 3 hours between 12-3 -which i find it impossible (he is 3.5), so then we end up going 4 times a day. Basically we take him at 9, then we need to pick him up at 12.30, and then return him at 3 and finally pick him up at 6.  U can imagine that this is so difficult when both of us work during the day and we have no additional help. It just becomes impossible. Any recommendations for any places that don't apply these limitations? I have heard that it is quite common.  Thanks\",\n",

The wifi network is visible, but after connecting to it I have no internet.  The landlord told me that the previous tenant had internet at Elisa and maybe something is wrong because of that. I wrote on Telia chat then they asked me to make an appointment to talk to a technician. The technician called to me and told to do the things I did before contacting them, i.e. unplugged the modem, unplugged the cables, swapped them around, but nothing. The technician also did not conjure up anything from the phone :(  I am poor at technical matters, and I care about having access to the Internet asap. My point is that I made an appointment with the technician on Thursday to come and see what's going on (earlier hours like 14-16 didn't suited me) But maybe someone has time today or during the week evening hours to take a look and try to fix it?

So, overall, his impression is that it is a summer cottage area, not really developed yet to the level of year round living, especially with young kids. And that to live there one would need some snow removal machinery, too, or SUVs or what not... Of course we weren't expecting Pirita level there but what he is telling now is a bit too disappointing for me, too. But I know there are people living there, including year round! What are your impressions, observations, coping techniques or what nots?

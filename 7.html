					<p>Hi everyone, new to the Group, I visit Tallinn every couple of months for a week of work.  My company Lingvist just launched their learn Estonian course (from English) in the last few weeks and are specifically targeting expats. It teaches vocabulary in contextual sentences and you can either practice your spelling by typing your answers or perfect your pronunciation with voice input.  It works wonders for developing passive vocabulary quickly in the short term (ie. Your reading comprehension increases rapidly) and over a longer period of use this translates into active use with spaced repetition.  I used the app for learning German before I started working for them and well… the fact I now work for them speaks for the fact it worked for me!!!  We are adding content all the time, our Android app is currently more advanced than iOS but iOS will catch up soon.  Any questions please reach out.  We are on Android, iOS and web</p></div>

					<p>Hey expats! My small international Pilates group in Kadriorg has a few spots available. I teach in English (obviously) and I'm looking for people already somewhat familiar with Pilates as this is an intermediate group. We do matwork as well as work with the equipment. Every Thursday at 18:00 in Vilmsi 45a. If you have been missing the small barrel and magic circle, this place is for you 😉 I can also open a new beginners group, if there are enough people interested. The groups are small - maximum 5 in Kadriorg and maximum 3 in Tõnismägi. Privates and duo classes also possible in both locations.  Send me a PM, if interested. I'm a physiotherapist who got enthusiastic about the Pilates method in 2015 and haven't stopped learning since. My last full comprehensive teacher training was this summer in the wonderful Pi Pilates studio in London.</p></div>

					<p>Hey, this has probably been asked a million times here, but I'd like to improve my Estonian speaking skills. Is anyone aware of a group or a club, where I could practice in a group? Native or non-native, it really doesn't matter. I already have an Estonian teacher, so I'm not really looking for one-to-one lessons or formal classes for that matter.</p></div>

					<p>Hey!  Is there any Language Courses available for people who don't have the e-ID? All the courses I see that take applications require some form of ID. Essentially, people on D-Visa's can't enter into language education?  Or is there something I am missing. I'd like to study part time but it looks like the only way is to self study with free resources which doesn't seem as effective. Thank you!</p></div>

					<p>Hola! I'm a certified and native Spanish teacher with 4 years of experience teaching Spanish online and face-to-face. During the last years I've helped more than a 100 students reach their goals in a matter of months. I've given Spanish tutoring to professionals that need to reach certain level of Spanish for work, high school students, people that want to improve their communication with their loved ones and, those that just enjoy learning a new language. Why learning a language with the support of a  certified tutor when I can just do Duolingo for free? Firstly, Duolingo and other language apps are GREAT and I'm all in when it comes to using technology to support learning.  However, it is… More</p></div>

					<p>I would like to hear some of your experiences. If a foreign kid (grade 1) goes to public school, the school offers extra Estonian class for the kid. Is that enough for the kid? Or they need private tutoring? How long (in average) does it takes for the kid to be able to catch the language? without private tutoring.</p></div>

					<p>What’s your Mother thongue? And how many people speak it in the whole World?  Estonia celebrates its native language day today or Emakeelepäev as we say. Under 1 million people in the whole wide world speak Estonian. Estonian language is strongly influenced by German, but in its closest to Finnish and Hungarian languages (Finno-Ugric language). Estonian is also considered to be one of the hardest languages to learn due to its 14 noun cases. First Estonian language book was printed in 1535 an it was Wanradt-Kiel Catechism.</p></div>

					<p>Hi all, can anyone recommend any Estonian language teachers? I'm looking to find a teacher who is able to come to my apartment in Kassisaba for a weekly lesson on a week night for a small group (2-3) of Estonian beginners.  I know there are free classes available but we're looking for more focused time with a teacher in the small group environment.  Apologies if this is not the correct place to post this and thanks for any suggestions 😄</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone. I have started learning Estonian using Speakly. It is a great app and I feel I am learning a lot. However, it involves a lot of guessing on my part about the mechanics of the language, so I would also like to have a student's book. Not an e-book or another app or google search. A good old fashioned book, with verb conjugations, pronouns, prepositions, rules etc., where I can see everything, highlight, keep notes etc. Have you used any such book that you can recommend? (I know there have been other posts about this, but I mostly see e-books and pdf, plus I would like the most up to date information on this). Thank you:).</p></div>

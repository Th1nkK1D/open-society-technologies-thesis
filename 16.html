					<p>🥳What's your New Year's resolution?🥳 Mine is to have more fun, laugh, and go to Edinburgh Fringe in 2023.

					<p>I just tried to mention Ahmed Saeed in a post and found out that he has left the group because he was being strictly censored here and his posts were not being published for weeks. I am sure most of us know him for his humor and his designation of being the brand ambassador of Prisma.  I personally have never found him post anything that defied the rules of this group and has always been dear to all of us because of his humor and prompt responses to help others in need. Do you think this censorship is fair? Would you like to have Ahmed back?</p></div>

					<p>Ok, who is watching TV6 and a fantastic dark comedy set in Estonia written by and starring Comedian Stewart Johnson … it’s bloody fantastic and I don’t know why I haven’t heard of it. Think it was released a coupla years ago so maybe pandemic f..up my memory of the release. Recommend it - got to watch the end now. Thank god adverts in Estonian last a millennium. It’s called The Chuck Band Show! Bloody hell I’m crying now. Let’s hope there’s another advert so I can give you a running commentary … or YOU CoULD WATCH it. Ok. Another advert - it’s about a comedian/radio host who lives in Tallinn, nearly loses his wife, mind and a ball to cancer .  Aren’t you glad you’re not sitting next to me while I talk over the film? Ok. Well you’ve bloody missed most of it by now…but I’ve just googled and it’s on Prime.</p></div>

The show is packed with stories about me hitchhiking in Europe, being stuck in Brazil during the pandemic, breaking laws in the Middle East and a lot more! ☀️ Pre-sale tickets available until 31.07! See you at Heldeke (Tööstuse 13)!</p></div>

Like let‚Äôs say I work for company X but got offer from company Y and I see that it‚Äôs possible to carry on both time and resourcewise. And company Y allows to do that, but not sure about X.  I found a quote on workinestonia.com which says that ‚ÄúIf you have a temporary residence permit for employment, and you keep fulfilling the conditions (keep working for the same employer, at the same position, and meeting all the requirements) of your residence permit then you can hold multiple positions simultaneously.‚Äù  So, technically it‚Äôs legally possible but I would like input from someone if they‚Äôre an HR representative or has legal knowledge about this sort of stuff or someone who has done this before.

Needless to say that this temperature is unbearable for people who come in the stores from outside. Don't let me start about the temperature in the apartments/working spaces.

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,12,21,1671620795000,"Question/Discussion: Why are Estonians against saying thank you? (my brosther in law being an example) I'm British and we have a compulsion towards saying please and thankyou, and of course sorry allot. Manners are different here, of course, but im curious to hear why being polite, saying please, thakyou or exhibiting humility and a gentle manner is rejected or actively avoided? Maybe the polite form is constructed inside gramar instead of a specific word used, like spanish or itallian has polite forms of ""you"" when speaking to those you dont know yet or older people etc.  It might be a resistance to see onself as a servent or subservient? But I feel saying please and thankyou recognises the free will of someone, in the sense that they are not obliged to do anything therefore one recognises their act as one made out of free will to assist and to show you are greatfull and not so egoistic as to expect service without any question. I look forward to hear your input, with all due respect and humility."

The contract particularly stated cash payment. We never had any problems. She had her special book and I had my own records. About 2-3 times, I paid into her account when she had to travel or I was away. So there's bank transfer evidence. There's also messaging about 18-20th of every month, when she comes to get her money - ""I am coming"", ""I am here"", every month.  On the last day of my stay in the apartment, we got into an argument. She denied having my deposit. She claimed the second month was not paid so it was the month in which my deposit was expended. At last she agreed to pay me a balance after the utility bills had been received and deducted from my deposit sum. We signed each others written statement and took pictures.  It's been 4 months and multiple reminders. Nothing.  She is an old lady and I had a good relationship with her. But I've lost my patience.  It's my money after all. Where can I report this?

The course will be conducted in Estonian but it's aimed at people who've already studied the Estonian language a bit (for example, have completed or are at A1-A2 level or more) and wish to practice while doing something fun. You don't have to be fluent but willing to try to participate in an activity in Estonian. The course will be on Wednesdays, 18:00-19:30 from 9th November until 14th December. The venue is in the Old Town. Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like to take part."

The building is really good insulated, which should be useful for this winter and the upcoming energy costs. Even in the last two very cold winters, I did not always need to turn on the heating in my flat, building heating was enough.  Parking spot in garage and a dry spacious storage are included as well.  I hope it goes into good hands, loved living there üíú https://www.facebook.com/groups/299056793537765/permalink/5171347919641937/?sale_post_id=5171347919641937Saadaval on imeline valgusk√ºllane korter otse Balti jaama ja Kunsti√ºlikooli vahel.

Aren't you supposed to simply be given the choice of choosing a new car each X years, and keep paying the monthly lease? And, downpayment? Lease conditions here in Estonia look more like a loan, than a lease. Please correct me if I'm not understanding the conditions on the fineprint."

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,10,9,1665323472000,"Easily the most picturesque of Old Town's lanes, this half-hidden walkway runs behind what used to be St. Catherine's Church.  It connects Vene street with the M√º√ºrivahe street.  What makes the passage particularly interesting is that it's home to the St. Catherine's Guild, a collection of craft workshops where artists use traditional methods to create and sell glassware, hats, quilts, ceramics, jewellery, hand-painted silk and other wares. The workshops are housed in the small, 15th- to 17th-century rooms on the south side of the lane, and are set up in an open-studio fashion so visitors can watch the artists at work, be it glass-blowing, weaving or pottery making. As absorbing as these displays can be, St. Catherine's passage is more about ambience than anything else. No other place in Tallinn combines creativity with a medieval atmosphere quite like it."

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,10,8,1665212372000,"Hello there, expats: I have a number of doubts about the new universal energy price given by the  Estonian government. Right now it's cheaper than what I had and Eesti Energia has moved me to the new service, but while I have a fixed price, the universal service is not fixed. That means that it could sky rocket and I could be paying double or triple than before.  Also, with the ""green"" package theoretically all my electricity should come from green sources but according to the Eesti Energia page all the electricity produced for the universal energy price comes from oil shale which is far from green. Probably there is something I do not understand here and I'm overthinking (what a surprise) but something feels off. Is there anyone around here that knows better and can resolve my doubts? Thank you."

Expats & Foreigners in Estonia,10,4,1664894439000,"Hi everyone, new to the Group, I visit Tallinn every couple of months for a week of work.  My company Lingvist just launched their learn Estonian course (from English) in the last few weeks and are specifically targeting expats. It teaches vocabulary in contextual sentences and you can either practice your spelling by typing your answers or perfect your pronunciation with voice input.  It works wonders for developing passive vocabulary quickly in the short term (ie. Your reading comprehension increases rapidly) and over a longer period of use this translates into active use with spaced repetition.  I used the app for learning German before I started working for them and well‚Ä¶ the fact I now work for them speaks for the fact it worked for me!!!  We are adding content all the time, our Android app is currently more advanced than iOS but iOS will catch up soon.  Any questions please reach out.  We are on Android, iOS and web"

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,9,26,1664202495000,"Fotografiska Tallinn presents over 100 Polaroid photos by Andy Warhol, some of which have never been shown to the public before. The exhibition is a tribute to Warhol‚Äôs iconic New York studio ‚ÄúFactory‚Äù and offers a particularly intimate look into the visual diary of the artist‚Äôs life and work.  Andy Warhol's art is so deeply embedded in our culture that it‚Äôs hard to imagine the shock, astonishment and fascination it once evoked. He was funny and brilliant at once. His pop art was the purest, the sharpest, the wittiest ‚Äì both the most direct and the most confusing. From the very beginning, his work hovered on the border between art and commerce, and he was able to blur the boundaries between the two more than any other artist ‚Äì not without a reason was his studio called the Factory. The display of the Polaroid snaps stays open until February 26, 2023. A ticket to Fotografiska costs 12 to 17 euros depending on the time of the visit."

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,9,12,1662982942000,"It's often asked how to save energy. My first advice is to check your boiler and it's settings. The water doesn't need to be so hot that you burn your hands. The water out of your tab should be at least 50 but not more than 60 degrees. Also you can safe further if you don't let it heat all day. Depending on the size of the boiler, the amount of water you are using and current price you can unplug it over the day and let it heat over the night. The boiler can easily keep the temperature. For the more ambitious people: I plugged the boiler to a smart switch which is connected with the smart home. The chart shows yellow the exchange price (pulled from nordpool), the red line is the average price of the day, the green line is my calculated limit, when the price falls under that line the automation will switch on the boiler. The blue line shows the power I am using."

Whether or not the place is off limits, is a rather grey area, one thing is for certain though - the roads leading there have rocks bigger than my.... anyway, if you really want to visit, do it discreetly, and I would recommend not using your car or motorbike, unless you don't mind huge stones damaging your vehicle."

I need to leave my apartment at 2300 hours but my flight isn't until 07.30 the next day. I don't mind spending the time at the airport. I'm hiring a bolt drive car but as has been reported you can no longer drop off the car at the airport.

Looking at the timetable that should be about around 0030 according to the timetable. Do you think that is a plan or does anyone have a better or easier suggestion for car drop off ar any other ideas? Thanks for any thoughts on this

My memory is that I did take a photo of the scooter, but of course, the photo does not show up on the memory of my iphone.  I have no proof, and everything depends on Bolt's internal system.  No signals, no bells, no warnings.   The ride was on Thursday, and I received the receipt today.. which is also odd.  Surely Bolt can tell if the rider's phone is 8 kilometers from the scooter, so why don't they at least have the app sound an alarm?   So much is wrong with this system IMO.. Also,  even if someone would like to help to signal a scooter which is left alone, with the light on, there is no way of doing it.

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,8,6,1659775297000,"Yesterday at the bar in Telliskivi, there was one person who got two drinks from me (deficit aren't paid automatically, somebody needs to pay for it) and just disappeared ( he basically took drinks and walked away fast, calling him didn't work). I couldn't follow him while there were 5-10 people waiting and leaving the bar unattended is not smart either. I was totally irritated + disappointed by his behavior. But thanks for the guy who was there (saw situation) and later he insisted to pay for those stolen drinks. I couldn't thank him enough for his care and humanity. But it is appreciated fully. It is great to have amazing people around with great attitude.  Ps. You got 2*x karma points from me!!! You can claim it back at any point and get 10 beers."

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,8,4,1659616609000,"Those who have been to Tallinn know that it‚Äôs a very compact city. And perhaps they also noticed that this town has distinctively different areas with vibes specific just for that area. Telliskivi Loomelinnak in Kalamaja is one of those places. It has a unique aura and vibe to it. You instantly feel relaxed, more open to new ideas, freshened up and perhaps even intrigued. From a tourist point of view the centre of this area could be Fotografiska Tallinn. The area around the photo gallery is dotted with street art. When visiting this area you have to pop into La Muu - first local company that started producing organic ice cream. Restaurant choice here is wide. You just need to walk around a bit and see what you fancy.  Telliskivi Creative City is a collection of former factory and railway buildings transformed into trendy area where locals hang out and travellers pass time."

PoWs are protected by guarantees of the United Nations, but this gesture shows us that Russia does not care about international interests and legislation,‚Ä¶ More"

"Expats in Tallinn, Estonia",7,29,1659066147000,"Hi all!!üëãüëãüëã I am thinking of moving to Estonia, next year, with my company. I am an interior designer plus I make hand made lamps from paper and other decorations. Altfel design studio is my company. I also have a 3 years old boy, but not yet sure if I will be moving as a single mom or with my husband. I would probably have a starting capital of 10 000eu as a single mom. My question is: is it possible to make a living out of this? Am I going to be able to provide safe and stable environment for my kid? How is the school system over there? Is there some kind of program for learning Estonian for free? What area of Estonia should we move? And also how is the market for buying a property, flip it and sell it? Is it easy to get a loan if you already have the property bought? Thanks and have a great day!!!"

The seller now states if we want to keep the lights (he claims there are crystal chandeliers) we need to pay xxx Eur (it's a lot). We have already signed an agreement with the notary, which does not mention these.  Are light fittings allowed to be removed if not specified? What else?  taps? The toilet seat? I exaggerate but I just want to get the point across . Does anyone know what my rights are here?"

Make sure you arrive at the airports a bit earlier than usual. Also if you have connection flight, make sure you have enough time between flights.  I transited through Brussels and Amsterdam airports yesterday.  I had a connection flight in Brussels but I missed it because the queue at the passport control was huuuge and I couldn't make it to the flight.  I had 1 hour 20 mins between my previous flight and connection flight but that wasn't enough.  So I took a train to Amsterdam to catch another flight. This time I arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before the scheduled time and that was just enough! The queues at the security check were huge and it took 1 hour 20 minutes to clear the security checkpoint.  Happy travels :)"

And often we don't pay attention what's the space around you actually looking like. So everyone is encouraged to pick up a chair or bench and to go out on your home street for a few hours. You could just see the time pass by or do some people watching. Alternatively you can read a book, ask a neighbor to join you for a board game, have lunch out, play an instrument or you name it.

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,5,10,1652214020000,"Solved ======= Hello, is there a way to extract any kind of certificate proving the time i worked in Estonia?  In my home country it's a standard procedure to receive such a certificate on the last day of employment, but here i didn't get anything. I wonder what i should present to authorities to claim years that i worked in other EU country. Apparently there are no strict regulations on how it has to look like, but i guess it has to be precise in dates.  I bet there's some governmental website where it could be stated, but I have difficulties finding it. Help needed. I thougt about pay slips from bank account, but they don't state exact dates on what day exactly i started and finished working, so they are no good. Thank uu"

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,5,5,1651774583000,"Hi guys, please help me to better understand how to get the appointment with family doctor here. We have insurance, we are registered with MyMed, but every single time we are ill (e.g. 4 yo child having fever over 39,5 dg.C. for more than 4 days), our doctor refuse to see us. On the other hand, when I don‚Äôt feel like need to see her, e.g. to get a referral letter which was already issued a year ago, there is no problem and I have an appointment in 3 days or so. It just seems to be impossible to get appointment to know which disease we contracted and how to cure it. If it was only me, ok, I can be a ‚ÄúGoogle graduated Doc‚Äù for myself, but for child‚Ä¶? Not so sure. So my question is - is it just our family doctor or is it standard here to refuse see ill children? And by any chance, do you have some recommendation for good family doctor in Viimsi area?"

In 2020, Due to covid, luxury hotels were really suffering and rental prices were crashing big time. This made it possible for us to find a very large apartment right above of Viru Keskus shopping mall. It was above the central Tram station, the bus station, and basically the heart of the city, right beside old town. If I wanted a supermarket, shop, gym, pretty much anything, all I had to do was take the elevator. Guests could use the malls parking lot for free (for the first 30 minutes).

In its current condition it is perfect for a single person or a couple, but it is possible to restore walls to make more private spaces in it.

Send me a PM if you'd like to see it in person, I'll open it for you. No agents please!  P.S. It is not available for rent, because a new house urgently needs investments."

I‚Äôm looking for an internship in the department of finance (or accounting). Ideally, I‚Äôm searching for a part-time internship (in addition to my current work). I‚Äôve contacted several Estonian start-ups but they either have extremely big number of emails in their inbox or just not looking for the candidates at this point. I do speak three languages fluently (Russian, Estonian, English) and have experience of working in different fields. As for my personal qualities, I consider myself as a very dynamic, motivated and reliable. I also think I'm very adaptable and enthusiastic when it comes to challenges and problems. I would be grateful if you could recommend a company or particular person (or maybe you are this person) willing to have free labour in their company for a month or two (I need 156 hours in total). It would also be a privilege to continue working for the company after the internship ends. Thank you! üôÇ"

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,3,18,1647604713000,"Dear Movie Enthusiasts! Estonian cinemas have an increasing issue, that animated films only screen Estonian and Russian dubs, making it impossible for English-speaking people in Estonia to enjoy animated films in cinemas. Same for just people who want to experience it with performances by the original cast. I've spoken to all Estonian cinema chains on the subject. The problem is cited as lack of audience interest for English screenings, which I think is not fully the case, as these English screenings are once-in-a-blue-moon occurrences and are very hard to catch, if there even is one (quite a lot don't even have a single showing).  There are 3 English screenings of ""Turning Red"" at Coca-Cola plaza, by Forum Cinemas over the weekend so if you're interested, it's a good chance to catch a screening with the original cast and also to show that there is a demand for English screenings."

Respect people regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, and their sexual and cultural background.  As some pointed out below, pro-feminist, LGBTIQ+, anti-war and pro-democracy protests are technically not tolerated by the authorities in Russia.

I know things are hard for everyone. But I am just knocking at all the doors possible. I don't know what else to do. Update: 03/03- 00h56. I managed to get a hold of them. Someone from this group helped look for Africans in Kherson and we were able to identify an individual through Facebook who accidentally happens to be one of the men on the video. I was able to video chat with them! They are still in Kherson, doing well. There are about 20 of them. They said that they have food. But the supplies will start running low from Friday. I also have a direct access to them now through two WhatsApp numbers. I will keep you posted."

First, because the new utility bill is incredibly high (500‚Ç¨ instead of 200‚Ç¨), second, because our salary got reduced by 30%, so we can't afford the apartment anymore. There's another reason though: we decided to live in two different apartments with my girlfriend instead of this one.  The landlord doesn't want to return the safety deposit only because we want to terminate it earlier, he thinks he's allowed to have a compensation for that. Although in the contract the reasons for not returning the deposit are those regarding the damages of the property, not a word about compensation for early termination. In the contract it says that any side can terminate the contract for a good reason without any time for a warning. Can our reasons be considered as good reasons by Estonian law of obligations? Apparently the landlord doesn't think so, while we do. Thank you in advance."

Although the amount was very little (Less than 1g per person), they were treated like dangerous criminals: Their hands got handcuffed behind their back, they got sent to the police station to be detained for hours, threatened with phrases like ""Do you want to be sent back home?"", made to give urine samples for testing, made to take off their jackets and shoes outside under snow for searching them and in the end got each served with hundreds of Euros in fine while they could've easily gotten a written warning and let go (According to google, that's what usually happens here with small amounts and first offence, which was the exact situation) What would you do in this situation?

Unfortunately, the one we use for our boy requires the the child sleeps for 3 hours between 12-3 -which i find it impossible (he is 3.5), so then we end up going 4 times a day. Basically we take him at 9, then we need to pick him up at 12.30, and then return him at 3 and finally pick him up at 6.  U can imagine that this is so difficult when both of us work during the day and we have no additional help. It just becomes impossible. Any recommendations for any places that don't apply these limitations? I have heard that it is quite common.  Thanks"

So I tagged some of the offenders from the beef steak thread so you might comment on this one.  Fifteen to twenty-five years ago I was in close contact with the cooks at Eeslitall, Pegasus, Von Kraali and others. I knew most of the suppliers. I can't say if it is so now but back then I was informed by the folks who supplied produce that NOTHING comes to Estonia first. ALL of the produce was picked-over by Finland from the north and the bigger countries if the produce came from the south. You were getting dregs and culls. I worked in Finland for 12 years and even the shuttle stores for K-Group, S Market and Prisma had a better produce selection and presentation. I have never seen a black, soggy avocado in Finland.

Expats in Tallinn/Estonia,1,9,1641729340000,"Hi guys, I signed a contract with Telia for home internet a week ago. Unfortunately, after connecting the router and modem I have no internet connection. The wifi network is visible, but after connecting to it I have no internet.  The landlord told me that the previous tenant had internet at Elisa and maybe something is wrong because of that. I wrote on Telia chat then they asked me to make an appointment to talk to a technician. The technician called to me and told to do the things I did before contacting them, i.e. unplugged the modem, unplugged the cables, swapped them around, but nothing. The technician also did not conjure up anything from the phone :(  I am poor at technical matters, and I care about having access to the Internet asap. My point is that I made an appointment with the technician on Thursday to come and see what's going on (earlier hours like 14-16 didn't suited me) But maybe someone has time today or during the week evening hours to take a look and try to fix it? Of course I can pay, or I can return the favor with some good craft beer or whatever :v Mustam√§e area"

So, overall, his impression is that it is a summer cottage area, not really developed yet to the level of year round living, especially with young kids. And that to live there one would need some snow removal machinery, too, or SUVs or what not... Of course we weren't expecting Pirita level there but what he is telling now is a bit too disappointing for me, too. But I know there are people living there, including year round!

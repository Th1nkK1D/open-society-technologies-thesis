					<p>Hello all, I have a question üòä. What (typical) Estonian do you like to bring as a gift or for your close ones to try? In these cases: 1) You fly with Ryanair and have only small or 10 kg cabin bag 2) You fly with Ryanair and have payed for 10-20 check-in bag 3) You travel to your home country by car (if possible üòâ). Thank you very much in advance for your tips!</p></div>

					<p>Does anyone have experience ordering from Amazon.de? Does it come direct to your door? Who delivers?

					<p>Hello Friends üòä I'm looking for a planters on wheels that can serve as an acoustic wall in our office. I have seen some in Tallinn ''specialized'' stores but 1000‚Ç¨ for a plastic box with wheels is beyond insane. I'm looking for something approx 1.5 meters tall X 1.5m to 2m long and about 30 cm wide. I need to buy like 6-7 of them. Do you have any recommendation?  Something like below üòá</p></div>

					<p>Dear Altruists, Those of you have legalised their documents at MOFA in Tallinn, which courier services you had used? If it's through Omniva, what would be the suitable method to send such documents faster and securely? Express letter or Registered letter?

					<p>Hello, everyone, I need the experienced friends who have brought a suitcase / goods here before with DHL or similar transportation companies. I would be very happy if someone has the knowledge.  My family sent me a suitcase from Turkey with DHL. There are winter items such as sweaters, coats, gloves, beanies, boots etc. inside.  A lady working at DHL Estonia told me that these items could not pass through customs duty free and that I did not meet the necessary conditions.  However; they asked me for a lot of information/documents such as my lease agreement, employment contract, residence permit, flight tickets, documents showing my entry into Estonia, proof that I have been outside the EU‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>Good evening!  Has anyone here ever missed their IKEA home delivery? If so, how did you retrieve your order after that?  I was supposed to have some stuff delivered tomorrow between 13 and 17, and only now was made aware of an event I can‚Äôt miss. I tried calling the IKEA support number, but there was no response since it‚Äôs after six. As the order has been handed over to the courier already, I don‚Äôt think I have that many options left.</p></div>

					<p>Hello all. I have a story + question and looking for an intelligent advice here. Recently I had to send documents to Helsinki. It was set in stone, that I have to send them, not bring in person. For some reason I decided that Omniva would be good for that. I packed documents with Omniva's tracking code and sent them from postkontor, expecting courier delivery to the place. But something went wrong and tracking told that letter was left in postimat. I knew that the organisation will never take it by themselves. So went to Omniva asking for courier delivery or returning documents back. Only latter choice was available. They did request and told me that Finland posti might answer with 2 months,‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>I know this is at my own risk... Hand luggage is too heavy for air Baltic, and yes I've already bought the extra hand luggage weight! Anyway, my question is for anyone that's flown Tallinn to Riga recently, do they typically weigh your hand luggage? I will then be flying Riga to Copenhagen, so again if anyone has travelled Riga to Copenhagen do they typically weigh in Riga? I will (probably/possibly??) take the chance that they don't weigh it? At my own risk I know, and I know I could end up with hefty charges. Thanks for any input!</p></div>

					<p>Hi guy!  What are some fees and how much do we have to pay for them when we ship equipments from outside of the European Union (specifically from southeast Asia - but I might also ship items from elsewhere)? For example This is the tools shop in singapore https://crimsonhides.com Or if you have other shops with lower fee to suggest that would be great too üòä</p></div>

					<p>Hello! I'm looking for recommendations for an international shipping company. I'm looking to move about 200 kilos of personal effects (books, photos, papers) from California to Tallinn. (I'm not looking for a full-service moving company that packs everything for you.) This will be a sea-freight, less-than-container-load shipment. If you have any relevant experience with or knowledge about such companies, let me know! Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>Dearest expats, I am looking for a suitcase. I would like it to be carry-on sized, have two wheels, and have a hard shell. And I'd like it to not be incredibly ugly, if possible. I thought finding one would be easy, but after visiting several stores and finding nothing I began to look online, where I still found nothing. It seems four-wheeled suitcases have completely replaced the two-wheeled variety.  Does anyone have any advice on where I might find such a thing, preferably in Tallinn?</p></div>

					<p>Folks, I'm ordering something big-ish (~11 kg) from Amazon.de As someone who has never ordered anything from Amazon.de, my "preception" was that they only deliver to Omniva-style smart boxes, instead of delivering to individual home/work addresses. However, this item is allowing me to just insert my office (or home) address, and doesn't ask for any smart box preferences. So my question is - will this item be delivered to my individual address or will they eventually come to a smart box and I'll have to pick it up?</p></div>

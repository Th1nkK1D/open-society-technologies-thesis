					<p>Hi - I was travelling to Paris via Ryan Air on 24th Mar and was returning on 09th Apr. However, I won't be able to travel now. I know there isn't a way to change your tickets free of charge. So if anyone was planning their trip along these dates, kindly contact me and I can transfer the ticket to you. Preferable for a reduced fee but maybe even for free since I'll be losing the money anyways. Best!</p></div>

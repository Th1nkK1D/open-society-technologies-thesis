					<p>Hey everybody, I have 2 black leather right handed gloves. I don't have the left side to match them, so I am giving these right side gloves to anyone who wants them. Alternatively, if someone has 2 left handed gloves, I could trade one for another, so that we each have one functional pair of gloves?  I hope no one loses their gloves during this snow storm ü•∂</p></div>

Women Didriksons parka size 36, great condition. Fully insulated, waterproof, lifeproof, comfortable and cute! - 90 ‚Ç¨ SOLD! Men Timberland boots size 42. Brand new! Waterproof, insulated, real leather. -120‚Ç¨ (if you have ever used Timberland boots you know it‚Äôs a stealüòÑ) Men Monton coat, size 53. Keeps you classy, keeps you warm (in mild winter more likely). 50% wool, good condition! - 35‚Ç¨ And since we‚Äôre already here, an extra item for ladies, since December means that the Christmas party season is coming! River Island cocktail dress, size 42 but I had it slightly adjusted (by a professional) to a smaller fit, so probably fits better on size 40 and height around 160. The dress is STUNNING, will get you all the compliments and you‚Äôll shine like a diamond‚ú® 25‚Ç¨. Please DM for more info or extra item pics. Pick up in Tallinn city center.</p></div>

					<p>Any recommendations for suit rentals? Have a "black tie" event coming up. Have a nice suit but my waist has...ahem...gotten wider since I got it.  So considering renting. Have looked up previous threads with this question in the group. To avoid repitition: - Suit Supply doesn't do rentals - Must Luik looks like it's for party costumes, doesn't seem like a serious place to rent a suit. - Yes, I can Google. Personal recommendations are valuable though! Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>Hello!  I am posting it here too as these boots have really saved us last winter.  Waterproof &amp; Very warm as there‚Äôs wool lining inside.  I wish they would still fit my kids but unfortunately I need to buy new.  They were bought new and are slightly used.  I would be delighted if they would find new owners as it‚Äôs a pity to keep them in their boxes.  Have a good one! üôÇ  https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/5844074822271397/</p></div>

					<p>Hello ! I did not see any recent posts on the subject, so : Do you have addresses for a good seamstress ? I want to have a skirt made with a specific fabric and I can't seem to find a reasonably priced offer. I want a skater skirt so it's a very simple, basic shape. By reasonably, I mean I can pay up to 100 euros - I had a quote at 200, 4√ó the parisian price for this kind of item. Thanks in advance !</p></div>

					<p>Hey all, I received my order of ON shoes yesterday, a size EU 47. It's bigger than expected. Will order a new one.

I bought it for ‚Ç¨139, and I am in a very good mood today thus I am making a ‚Ç¨1 discount. Selling for ‚Ç¨138, ON shoes Cloud 5, all black, EU47.  Location: Tallinn.</p></div>

					<p>Hello,  I am beyond frustrated and maybe some of you can offer help! Our family dr is moving to another clinic and apparently this means we have to move with him. The clinic is being very unhelpful and i really liked the dr but jot enough to go to a clinic that is quite far from where we live. Do you know any English speaking clinics that may take us in the city center? I seriously don't understand why if the dr is changing jobs I have to move with him without any choice :( Thank you!</p></div>

					<p>Expats can talk in English only between 15:00 - 17:00 Edit: Thank you all for your comments. My point was 1220 is a first point of contact for any emergency health care services. I felt, at least, it should have been in English as well, as an expat it really gives some confidence in such situations. Yes, I understand in hospitals it is really not possible for always. :)</p></div>

					<p>Saw this post in another group for mums but am sure it‚Äôs worth sharing more widely: there is a special service in Tallinn where you can get a doctor visiting your sick (under 12 old) child over the weekend by calling 6971145. Home visits will be made by a general practitioner or paediatrician together with an emergency medical technician of Tallinn Ambulance on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 2 pm to 10 pm.  ü©∫üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüè• https://www.tallinn.ee/en/news/home-doctor-can-be-called-tallinn-children-12-years-old?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=september_2022&amp;fbclid=IwAR0XF48tmDoTAboCSxv9wAO-0o8dr-1OaBhe36lQvTYvEbx0MuiKTApf5KM</p></div>

					<p>Hi guys, please help me to better understand how to get the appointment with family doctor here. We have insurance, we are registered with MyMed, but every single time we are ill (e.g. 4 yo child having fever over 39,5 dg.C. for more than 4 days), our doctor refuse to see us. On the other hand, when I don‚Äôt feel like need to see her, e.g. to get a referral letter which was already issued a year ago, there is no problem and I have an appointment in 3 days or so. It just seems to be impossible to get appointment to know which disease we contracted and how to cure it. If it was only me, ok, I can be a ‚ÄúGoogle graduated Doc‚Äù for myself, but for child‚Ä¶? Not so sure. So my question is - is it just our family doctor or is it standard here to refuse see ill children? And by any chance, do you have some recommendation for good family doctor in Viimsi area?</p></div>

					<p>Last year I have booked an appointment for a gastric sleeve surgery which is supposed to take place in June 2022, now a month away from the procedure I am thinking to go for gastric bypass or no surgery at all. I was convinced with sleeve but afraid from reflux, bypass is good but I'm scared of dumping syndrome. I am above 40 bmi. I am scared of complications and too much restrictions and commitment to lifetime vitamins. My life turned to a disaster after marriage. Now divorced. Two minor children. Very bad financial situation. No pleasure in life except food. What do you guys advise?</p></div>

					<p>Hi, my wife recently fell from a scooter at Kadriorg park and broke her humerus, and a delicate surgery will be needed because it was near the elbow joint. The surgery is scheduled for next week at Regionaalhaigla so I'd like to hear from your experiences what should we expect from an orthopaedic surgery at this hospital since the treatment we had so far wasn't very clear, we only (barely) talked to the nurses after the CT scan and they notified us about the surgery - with a not so good english, but they were very caring and really tried to be helpful - we also had spoken to the doctor before CT scan and their decision of a surgery but that was it. I've seen someone report here that they didn't have a great experience with a similar surgery there and had some complications afterwards, so you may understand my concern. Thanks</p></div>

					<p>hello there, has anybody been in a similar situation with Eesti Haigekassa? So in the end of January I sustained an injury in Kalamaja where I slipped on ice. It resulted in me sustaining a fractured humerus bone that needed surgical treatment. As a result of surgery, I developed radial nerve palsy, so I wear a wrist orthose 24 7 (it is quite a common complication of ORIF / my hand is basically like a jelly). As my job involves working with my hands, I am still on sick leave. However it has been almost 1 month that my case in in process with Haigekassa and it is super annoying because I want my money (my employer sent me just 450 Euros last month). The issue that they claim is the cause of delay was  that my injury was sustained within my first 14 days of employment. Any tips</p></div>

					<p>Update: Someone from Tallinn is giving me a tube of Neosporin and also getting more from the US. Thank you for your help everyone! I‚Äôm really overwhelmed and thankful with the response and willingness to help ‚ù§Ô∏è Hi everyone! I am in urgent need of finding one of the following: Baneocin (Baltic countries, Russia?) Known equivalents: Neosporin (USA, no prescription needed)  ^ Update: Sold in India as well.  Bactroban (Ireland, prescription status unknown) Dermisone Tri Antibiotica (Spain, no prescription needed) We were prescribed Baneocin for my infant son‚Äôs post surgical care, which is the only thing that seems to work (Braunovidon isn‚Äôt helping), but no pharmacy in Estonia has it, and apparently it‚Äôs been backlogged from the supplier for months now. We used the last of a tube a friend gave us a few days ago and are unable to find anything else that works here.  If anyone by any chance has a tube of anything on the list and is willing to sell it, or is coming back from any of those countries in the next few days and can get it for me, please contact me. Thank you!</p></div>

					<p>Hello! Should I visit an ophthalmologist or an optometrist for eye examination (for vision conditions like myopia) in Estonia? I'd prefer going to an ophthalmologists since they can diagnose other problems too, but do they actually measure for astigmatism or myopia and prescribe glasses? Secondly, are contact lenses covered by health insurance and if not, does one need prescription to buy them?</p></div>

					<p>My Tallinn hospital experience At the end of January I wanted to get a new mobile phone from Mobipunkt in Kalamaja, where I had a very bad fall on the ice and fractured my humerus bone. Yesterday I had surgery at Mustamae regional clinic. I developed a slight complication from the surgery called Radial nerve palsy so fun times... That being said. There is a lot of criticism regarding Estonian healthcare. However during my operative experience, the nurses and doctors were absoloute angels. I am 24, work in Estonia with no family here. They were so kind and lovely. A big thanks to the Orthopedic staff in Regionalhaigla. Very attentive, kind, professional.</p></div>

					<p>Hey gang, some of you might already know this, but a fellow expat needs our help! On December 2nd, two up and coming comics in Estonia were involved in a traffic collision. Tambet Sild (22) passed away at the scene. The other, Caleb Brunick (23) was rushed to the hospital unconscious. Caleb remained in a coma for several weeks, and the doctors were not optimistic about his condition. However, against all odds, he is fighting hard. But, he has a long road ahead, perhaps even years, until complete recovery. Even though the Estonian healthcare services here have done an incredible job, he needs to go back to the US for further treatment and care.  Please, consider donating to help him and his family get him home:</p></div>

					<p>Oh dear, my colon problems have gotten national Turkish media talking about Estonia. I'll provide a full update on my rehabilitation in the near future. I'm just waiting to have my stitches removed first. I did 2 interviews and with separate film crews. During the second interview yesterday, one of the film crew fainted and collapsed in my hospital room. Hospital emergency staff rushed in and carried her out. She fainted due to low blood sugar. It was a little jarring to then try and continue the interview. I thought that I should make a number of corrections regarding things that these news papers got wrong (in case anyone else wanted to share the articles here). 1, I'm Dutch not Estonian.‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>Thank you everyone for all your help! This would not have been possible without your help. The surgery appears to be a success though I will only know for sure once the recovery period is over. I spend most of yesterday being delirious from the anesthesia.  Unfortunately they have to do an open surgery rather than a keyhole laparoscopic surgery so the recovery will be a bit slower than expected. The hospital staff as well as my Turkish friend Nuri, are helping me with walking as it's critical for my recovery.  Overall I'm extremely positive about this. For the first time in over 4 years I have hope for my future. I won't have to spend my days trapped on the toilet in terrible pain. I can return to being a productive member of society üòÉ</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone,  I am looking for a family doctor, can someone help guide on how to go by it? I find the process very confusing and I'd appreciate if anyone on this group can explain the process.  Moreover, I looked into the list of doctors available and have identified a potential family doctor, however, how do I register myself with the doctor? Is there a form or some sort of registration process?  Would appreciate your feedback and responses. Thanks.  PS. Happy New Year to all!</p></div>

					<p>Hey, expats! My expat friend living in Tallinn was recently diagnosed with a serious and life-threatening colon ailment that needs to be operated on. Without the operation he will die within the next few years, after being in constant pain and, frankly, torture from his condition. Sad news - Estonian hospitals won't operate on him due to keeping space for Covid patients and those, whose conditions are more time-critical.  Good news - he found a hospital in Turkey that agreed to do the operation at a reasonable price. Bad news - even the reasonable price is currently more than he and his family can afford.  Hence my little plea here - if you can spare even a euro or two, it would be‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

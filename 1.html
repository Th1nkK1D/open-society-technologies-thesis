					<p>Many people have told me that job application works better here when supported by internal referals. In that sense it would be nice to have a directory of the companies people in the group are working at.  Maybe this can be compiled in an internal document if you do not mind sharing this kind of information: simply the contact name and the name of the company. Just and idea.</p></div>

					<p>Hey lovely folks, Is there an option to start a career in IT without prior knowledge? Have some companies here a training program that helps you to get a foot in?  I have some little coding experience from university and interest to take part in a training program. Unfortunately, I am more a getting taught - practice type person and not someone who could teach himself everything from A to B. My background is mostly in logistic. So companies in E-Commerce would be interesting. Let me know</p></div>

					<p>Good early morning! Where would one look to find a young woman who might be interested in a paid marketing/promotion gig? Someone who is good at social media, doesn't mind talking on camera and who can speak English. A female friend of mine is looking to hire someone between the ages of 18 - 25. Has to be good with apps likes Instagram, tiktok, Facebook, Twitter and maybe even Reddit. An already established social media presence/following would be a big plus, but is not required. Any ideas where I could find interested applicants? When I was in university I knew a few such people, but I'm not a student anymore nor can I just loiter around at universities. üòÖ</p></div>

					<p>Heya! I'll share a post about freelancing and how to be creative when choosing a career üåø Hope it adds some inspiration to your day üåûI‚Äôve always wanted to study law and see if the myths about it are true. Do lawyers really simplify disputes? Do they stand for ethics and fairness? And do they all wear suits? During my studies, I attended as many internships as possible. I got an overview of the whole legal system through different institutions. I wrote articles, participated in legal organizations and worked at a law office. After graduating, many of my coursemates put on ties, switched to serious-looking profile photos and found the most comfortable desks in big corporations at their 9 to 5 jobs. I was hesitating. I enjoyed law, but couldn‚Äôt find a place where I could work in coherence with my personal values and inner‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>Hey everyone!  This is kind of urgent: i have a friend who had his TRP based on a job permit. Now he is unemployed and was looking for a job for a while. He needs a job that offers the residency based on work otherwise he will be forced to go back very soon.  Does anyone have any opportunities or knows about where to look / has tips on how to deal with it.  Thank you üôè Edit: Thank you all for your answers. He did try wise but they were very strict in the selection that he didn‚Äôt get a role.  For now, any job would do really. He has experience in waitering (was a manager for customer relations and booking for one restaurant), and photography/videography.  He has a degree in philosophy but I highly doubt that would get him anywhere on the job market in such a short notice.  If anyone thinks they have an opportunity for him, let me know and i will send you a PM with his linkedin profile</p></div>

					<p>Hello expat friends, My fianc√© and I are preparing to move to Tallinn and are looking for jobs. Would anyone be so kind to share their job-seeking experience?

We're looking for jobs in corporations or start-ups or even translation offices, so if anyone works in these settings I'd be thankful to hear your thoughts. Thank you and have a wonderful day üåü</p></div>

					<p>Hello, I‚Äôm a second-year student at Tallinn University of Technology acquiring bachelor‚Äôs degree in International Business Administration with specialisation in finance. I‚Äôm looking for an internship in the department of finance (or accounting). Ideally, I‚Äôm searching for a part-time internship (in addition to my current work). I‚Äôve contacted several Estonian start-ups but they either have extremely big number of emails in their inbox or just not looking for the candidates at this point. I do speak three languages fluently (Russian, Estonian, English) and have experience of working in different fields. As for my personal qualities, I consider myself as a very dynamic, motivated and reliable. I also think I'm very adaptable and enthusiastic when it comes to challenges and problems. I would be grateful if you could recommend a company or particular person (or maybe you are this person) willing to have free labour in their company for a month or two (I need 156 hours in total). It would also be a privilege to continue working for the company after the internship ends. Thank you! üôÇ</p></div>

					<p>üá∫üá¶ Hello, my name is Nastia and I have just arrived to Tallinn.  I left Ukraine couple weeks ago for personal reasons and the plan was to continue to work for Ukraine online but as it is evident I cannot do this now.  I have the place to stay but no job...  So if someone knows where I can look for, it would be great help.  In Ukraine I worked for French culture centre "Alliance Fran√ßaise" as a French teacher. I speak Russian, English and French.  Used to work with children before at French kindergartens in Kiev and Indianapolis, the USA And in general I worked in many different places and I have lots of experience in different spheres.  Any help will be highly appreciated!</p></div>

					<p>Hi! I have a question especally from those who have experience in IT or software engineering. But anybody who has a recommendation is welcome to put in their two cents! besides some other subjects, i am especially considering studying IT in coming years. I do not have any background in information technology, but I have background in sciences and other subjects so do you recommend to start with a bachelor or a master in computer science or some other kind of vocational IT qualifications in Estonia? Secondly do you know of some online tests that can test if my personality, knowledge, skills, way of thinking is suitable for this career? I am not yet sure but definitely it is one of my considerations. Your help can make it easier to choose and I hope other people who are considering same thing as me can also benefit from this post! Thank you very much.</p></div>

					<p>Hello, i'm looking for a 'closer' (sales representative) that will close pre-qualified leads, in english language on zoom or on the phone.  Leads will be from USA, India, England and Canada. Few hours per week can easily bring an additional income of 1000 to 3000‚Ç¨ per month (if you are skilled). You must be available to close leads as soon as they arrive.  If you speak french, you can learn from my closer working on the french market. His income is 100% from this business.   This opportunity will start in several months, and i'm taking applications right now.  You can send me a messenger text with your phone number, and your introduction. Please specify if you speak french.</p></div>

Refuge Estonia is a non-profit organisation that have been since the unfortunate beginning of the war in Ukraine helping on the front, by going there to bring supplies such as food, health product and cars.

					<p>Friends, we invite you to watch a movie about Mariupol - the city, which Russian terrorists destroyed fully. This is one of the cities and places in Ukraine, where the biggest cruelty, violence, inhumanity took place and still all this disaster continues for local residents. In Estonia we have a huge wave of Ukrainians from Mariupol, who had chance to escape or were forced to pull to Russia. For many people from Ukraine, who live in Estonia now, this was a real life.  The movie with English and Estonian subtitles, admission is free.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone, You must have already heard about ’super floods’ in Pakistan which have left 1/3rd of the country under water, with 33 million (and counting) people displaced and over a thousand dead. Over 2 million acres of farm land has been affected, and around half of Pakistan’s cotton crops have now been destroyed. Agriculture accounts for ~ 25% of Pakistan’s GDP, and cotton is a major export.  To put this into perspective, 33 million means around 87% of the population of Canada. In terms of damage to economy too, it’s a HUGE hit for the country.  It breaks my heart to watch news from back home and so I’m sharing with you some reliable places you can donate to.  1. Go Fund Me has compiled… More</p></div>

					<p>The Maarjamäe memorial in Pirita area, depicting the journey of the victims of communism, is dedicated to Estonian people who suffered the terror of the Soviet regime. The memorial consists of two parts – 'Journey', with name plaques of the victims, and a symbolical 'Home Garden', with informative texts and stone tablets marking the sites of terror. The memorial includes a monument dedicated to Estonian officers who fell victim to Communist terrorism. Estonia lost a fifth of its population of just over one million to Soviet terrorism, many of whom still rest in unmarked graves. The memorial complex is dedicated to the victims of communism and serves to remind us of the fragility of freedom and human life.  Vast park area next to the sea is also a pleasant place for long walks.</p></div>

					<p>Hello amazing people. Today at 6pm on Vabaduse Valjak will be protest against Russian aggression. We usually think that what happened it could not be worse anymore, but then Russian terrorists show us the opposite. This weekend Russia made a terrorist act against our prisoners of war. In the village Olenivka (Donetsk oblast) they held Ukrainians solders in a local colony, on the 29th July Russians blew up the colony with Ukrainian prisoners and killed more than 50 people (but no one knows the exact numbers), and a lot of PoWs are wounded. PoWs are protected by guarantees of the United Nations, but this gesture shows us that Russia does not care about international interests and legislation,… More</p></div>

					<p>Installation “Wagon of tears” on Freedom square in Tallinn remembers and commemorates the thousands of people deported on June 14 in 1941. Half of the tears are in Ukraine colours this year… Deportation stories have found their ways into local poets creation. On the square you can hear some of the poems presented by local actors. And before you ask, the balloons will not be released.</p></div>

					<p>We ask those who can contribute a little. :) Short version: Many Ukrainian war refugees do not have anything to eat, and we are trying to help them. https://toeta.me/projects/toidukorv-sojapogenikele/ Long version: At the moment, more than 40 thousand Ukrainian war refugees have already arrived in Estonia and it is estimated that around 30 thousand have remained here. Many of them arrived here by a difficult route, leaving behind a lot of basic necessities. And it has not been easy for many of them to start out here either. There are support groups, people have organised basic necessities, furniture, clothes, they have helped with accommodation. But many have either simply not been lucky,… More</p></div>

					<p>Hi, guys, to tell the story short: we’re from Ukraine and my friend Yaroslav(https://t.me/yarik_vv) has direct access to the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces which are working in the east, and which are in need of much stuff - starting from USB flash drives and ending with various vehicles (we’ve got quite a long list). Now the top priority here is thermal imaging monoculars - to do their specific tasks they need Pulsar Helion 2 XP50 PRO and XQ50 and vehicles. We have already raised around 9.5K USD targeting close friends and people we know and have already purchased 2 thermal imagers from Poland and Austria. This time we decided to expose our little initiative to support Ukraine to a wider… More</p></div>

					<p>Hi, I created a charity- and handicrafts club called A Stand with Ukraine. (Get the pun? It’s like a booth/stand and also like “standing for” Ukraine.)  Our booth is next to Vabaduse Väljak (the Freedom Square) by Suur-Karja 18 and it’s usually manned between 9:30 and 17ish if the weather is good. We get together with a group of Ukrainian refugees and local Estonians once a week in my home. My goal is to help them make friends and de-stress together by creating pretty arts and crafts, drinking tea together, gossiping a little and letting our children play together. They also have an opportunity to make some money in a way that involves zero bureaucracy. The women whose husband is still in… More</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone 🤗 my parents are hosting a Ukrainian family. We have managed to find a job and accommodation for them, but we'd be super grateful if someone could donate 1-2 bicycles (ideally for women, but not a must) for them, as the bus connection to work for both of them is very long and it would be easier to reach work by bike. Thank you in advance 💞</p></div>

					<p>Hey everyone, I just wanted to shortly promote my work and show how easy it is to disprove Russian propaganda. As you may know, two rockets hit Kramatorsk railway station on 8th of April at 10:30. The missiles used were of the type Tochka-U. Russian authorities made the claim they could not be behind the attack as they do not use these types of missiles. In this thread I both prove that is not the case and also show that prior to and right after the attack, Russian Telegram channels actually PROMOTED the attack as theirs. I  have also written several articles of analysis on other topics related to the war.</p></div>

I'm wondering if other Chinese media (except those from Hong Kong &amp; Taiwan) actively support Putin's invasion of Ukraine? I'm asking here because I would like the perspective of Chinese expats living in Estonia, and how they compare the Chinese media from different countries.</p></div>

					<p>This is absolutely true. I've been teaching English to people from around the world (online) as well as many Russians. The vast majority support this war and see "The West" as a single entity that is the enemy. Moreover, much of many other populations also support the War. Serbia, Malaysia, China, Indonesia to name but a few countries where the Media and the population largely support the invasion of Ukraine. (please google how Russian propaganda has succeeded in those countries instead of accusing me of making it up. You'll find plenty of news sources and videos from people of those countries, supporting Russia). I'm not talking about Russians living abroad. I'm speaking about Russians in… More</p></div>

					<p>Fear, heartache, broken dreams, homes left behind, ripped apart families, lost lives, destruction, hunger, uncertainty - this was deportation 73 years ago in Estonia. More than 22 000 Estonian people were taken to Siberia by force.  A remembrance installation on Freedom square today and tomorrow (25. and 26.03) highlights the boarders of Soviet Union. Red rail tracks show where people were taken.  For many years this event highlighted something written on history books. Today unfortunately it's reality to many people. Ceremony will take place at the Victims of Communism Memorial. Patarei prison will be lit in Ukrainian flag colours for the evening.

					<p>Update: African Students in Kherson, Ukraine. A few weeks ago, I requested help for a group of Africans stuck in Kherson, Ukraine. I wanted to let you that they have made it safely to Poland last night where they are receiving support from an organization. I wanted to give a shoutout to Kristilee Frost  for trying her very best to organize their evacuation FOR WEEKS. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridors remain unopened in Kherson, and thus, her hands were tied.  The students actually made a decision to leave at their own risk and peril. They were successful in their second attempt.  Thank you all!</p></div>

					<p>Hello Dear All. Sorry if my question is stupid, I am not as familiar with the Ukrainian refugees help in Estonia as I am with that in Finland. I have quite a few things for little kids that I could donate. The refugee families I am helping here have children of different ages and don’t need those things. Overall Finnish storages of such stuff seem to be over-filled. What is the situation in Estonia, is such stuff still needed? I’m cowing to Estonia in a couple of weeks and could bring stuff with me if there is a need for it. Where should I bring it?</p></div>

I have a business/employment proposal that I hope can help a couple of Ukrainian people for employment and (I hope) longer-term security, as follows: I'd like to start a business making Ukrainian embroidered shirts (вишиванки, vyshyvanky) for men and women. I think lots of people in Estonia would like to wear Ukrainian symbols right now, and it's also very hard to find good quality embroidered shirts outside Ukraine -- I know because I love the style and have tried to buy them for years! I want to make a "cooperative" style business: See Wikipedia, but it's one where employees have the right to vote on the board and the use of profits. It's a kind of "business by democracy" because… More</p></div>

					<p>Hello expat community!  We are organizing the second "Art Against War" auction. Estonian artists are coming together to support people in Ukraine and donating their art to fundraise money to support Ukraine!  Last time we had more than 70 art donations and we raised 57,605€. 100% was donated to support refugees organizations in Estonia.  This time we want to support and protect Ukrainian men and women fighting for our families and for our freedom. All the money raised will go towards buying equipment like vests, helmets, etc. This time it will be only up to 30 art objects and mostly done by young Estonian artists.

					<p>In March 1944 Tallinn survived massive bombing by the Soviet Air Force. 554 lives were lost, over 1500 buildings destroyed, many other houses badly damaged. Old Town was also hit hard. Particularly Harju street. And all this sounds dreadfully familiar today… To honour the victims back in 1944 and in todays war in Ukraine, candles were lit on Harju street.</p></div>

					<p>Hi! Are there any refugees here from Russia? I read trains and/or buses are fully booked from St. Petersburg to Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki to flee Putin's Russia in fear of what's coming there by its leadership. Please read before you post! Edit: As I see some people posting hostile messages here based on nationality, it's better to emphasize some points. Respect people regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, and their sexual and cultural background.  As some pointed out below, pro-feminist, LGBTIQ+, anti-war and pro-democracy protests are technically not tolerated by the authorities in Russia. Nevertheless many local people are still trying, tens of thousands according to reports. A part of these people might be among those fleeing Russia now.  This is what the question was about. Respect the rules of the group, respect other people.</p></div>

					<p>🇪🇪🇺🇦 The Estonian Institute of Historical Memory and the Estonian Heritage Society invites everyone to commemorate the innocent victims of the 1944 March bombings of Tallinn and the war that has begun in Ukraine. The commemoration event takes place on 9 March at 19:15 in Harju Street and the surrounding green area in Tallinn. We kindly ask everyone to bring along candles and igniters, as the number of candles and igniters provided by the organizers is limited.

					<p>Hello to everyone. Could you help me spread the message. Im trying to get ride sharing platforms to offer free rides from the border points to destinations. Also try to do it in a more safe way that it is done today. Thank you!!!Plead for ride sharing platforms in Europe! Open your platforms for Ukrainians fleeing from borders, give an option to use your platform without credit cards and for free. Same for drivers.  Offer this option only for refugees from Ukraine.  There are thousands of EU cars lined up to take people where they wish, and on the other side there are tens of thousands of Ukrainians who wish to get to different destinations. Problem nr one- this matching is done like it was done in 19th centry- standing with a poster next to the refugee center. The volunteers are writing down the transport needs one by one and doing the matching manually. It is very very slow. Promoting your services at the refugee… More</p></div>

					<p>Dear all, today I had an epiphany about being more involved into helping the Ukrainian struggle and I felt I want to do more then just sporting an Ukrainian flag or chatting about it with my friends from my comfy sofa. So I tried to find some useful infos on how to help but here on this group or elsewhere the amount of associations or private initiatives are simply too much. So I will repost here what Helene Vetik posted yesterday, to guide you through the jungle of Facebook posts, Instagram stories and shouting men in Baltijaam. And choose the right thing to do. Stàa alegher!/take care</p></div>

					<p>As watching today the press conference the important thing that stood out is that we need to stand together and protect our people, our country.  The ministers talked that we shouldn't hurt residents in our country who have emigrated from other countries, especially russians, and of course other foreign nationals. We are an understanding, caring nation and country. Let's hold our people and care for them more and more everyday. We know that the war isn't against russians but the president of Russia. Also, our own people should think if it's reasonable to go to another country's territory and start fighting because we don't want the same thing happening in our own territory, especially when Estonia will be represented out in the open amongst ourselves. Estonian government won't be able to help you when you get hurt or even if you'll get taken as prisoners there. We can help the refugees here - making donations, providing accommodations etc. Slava Ukraini! 💙💛</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone. The BBC just published a video of a group of African students stuck in Kherson city. They are all very young; they are lost and despaired as they are running out of basic necessities like water. Please let me know if there is someone we can contact there. I know things are hard for everyone. But I am just knocking at all the doors possible. I don't know what else to do. Update: 03/03- 00h56. I managed to get a hold of them. Someone from this group helped look for Africans in Kherson and we were able to identify an individual through Facebook who accidentally happens to be one of the men on the video. I was able to video chat with them! They are still in Kherson, doing well. There are about 20 of them. They said that they have food. But the supplies will start running low from Friday. I also have a direct access to them now through two WhatsApp numbers. I will keep you posted.</p></div>

					<p>🇬🇧 Art is my weapon Today I figured out how to use it in the battle for Ukraine. I will make you a tattoo and donate all money to the Ukrainian Army. Since all the money goes to charity, you can pay any amount you wish, but the minimum reasonable price is €50. One important note is if I'm physically not capable of handling your request right away, you can still buy a voucher to help Ukraine now, and we can schedule a session later. If you're not in Estonia, we can meet in Europe when the war ends. If it's easier for you to transfer the money, send it directly to the Ukrainian bank and send me the confirmation. Then we'll make you a great tattoo for you to be proud of. The plan is the… More</p></div>

					<p>Hello Dear All. Not sure if it's been widely announced yet but I just got a confirmation from the Border authorities about letting Ukrainians in without so called "travel passports".</p></div>

					<p>🇺🇦🇺🇦 some thoughts on our collective response to the war in ukraine. it feels like the whole world has gone mad. it probably only feels like that because my world has become ukraine ever since the war started. my family and friends are currently there just trying to survive and i see a mob mentality forming around me. my biggest worry is that out of a pure place of "helping ukraine" many people could do a lot of unintended harm. i see fear rising everywhere and hatred following. i see people celebrating death and calling for more. i see fighting among friends and families about who to blame and how to punish them. but the only thought i'm left with is "can't we punish putin tomorrow? could… More</p></div>

					<p>Regarding the situation in Ukraine: I'm well aware that there are many people in the country right now who do not hold EU, Ukrainian or perhaps no passport at all. They have a right to leave a war zone just like everybody else. There are now two major groups for helping out refugees and I have spotted some useful information here. I'll post screenshots of groups here, pls feel free to join in and spread the word! Slava Ukraini!</p></div>

					<p>We secured a house (4 beds) near the Ukrainian border in Poland for our Ukrainian colleague and her family for a month. We organized transport for them on both sides of the border.  Last minute my colleague and her family decided to stay in Ukraine. That means we now have an unused free housing (non refundable) ready to host a family for a month. If we cancel it I believe the house will not be given to a Ukrainian family or it might be resold at a price out of reach for many (we paid 4K eur). It is 50km from the border in Zwierzyniec, Poland. Please DM me if you know any Ukrainians who can use this free housing or know of an organization that can connect us to Ukrainians who need housing.</p></div>

My husband and I are have been following the news on what's happening in Ukraine,  and we are so desparate wanting to help. This morning my husband purposed to build a website and we brainstormed all the ideas we have, and we came out with this website https://with-humanity.vercel.app/ So, this website is for anyone who need evacuations and to those who provide shelter. You can check out the link I've attached and simply click "send request" in the top right corner on the website, from there you will just follow the flow and fill what's your need. We truly hope our website can be helpful. Thank you everyone!</p></div>

					<p>Ukraine asked more than a week to disconnect RF from SWIFT. This would stop RF to export gas and put economic pressure. As of now European countries divided to this small favour. Let's face the truth as in 1938 as Europe abandoned Cheslovakia now they abandoned Ukraine.</p></div>

					<p>Pass on - a house for Ukrainian refugees in BulgariaIn these grim times of human tragedy and hardship for Ukrainian people, I would like to offer this house as a shelter for two Ukrainian families fleeing from war. The house is located at some 50 kilometers from Sofia, has food supplies and is fully equipped for normal living.  #Ukraine, you are not alone! В тези мрачни времена на човешка трагедия и трудности за украинския народ, бих искал предоставя тази къща за подслон на две украински семейства, бягащи от войната. Къщата се намира на около 50 км от София, напълно оборудвана е за нормален живот и има хранителни провизии. #Украйна, ние сме с теб!</p></div>

					<p>[UKRAINE WAR - INFORMATION ABOUT CROSSING TO POLAND] I have seen some posts asking about what are the "rules" for crossing to Poland. Maybe this will help someone. Additionally, there's free psychological help offered for people fleeing Ukraine, also in Ukrainian and Russian (more info below). From what I read, there is a lot of willingness to accommodate and help the refugees - both from individual people, businesses and the state. Here you will find free psychological help: 669 981 038 - free emergency telephone of the Polish Migration Forum in Ukrainian and Russian (the telephone works on Mondays from 4 to 8 PM, on Wednesdays from 10 AM to 2 PM and on Fridays from 2 PM to 6 PM) 22 566 22 27 - free telephone support of the Damian Medical Center in Polish and Russian (open on Tuesdays from 8am to 1pm, Wednesdays from 5pm to 8pm and on Fridays from 8am to 1pm) 12 421 92 82 - free 24/7 number of the Crisis Intervention Center in Krakow. It is also possible to help on the spot, at ul. Radziwiłłowska 8b. Online help is also available after prior telephone contact</p></div>

					<p>Hello.... I am a bit worried about this kind of news.... Since Putin said that if a different state enters the current conflict, there will be consequences like never in history.... Does anyone know if the sending of arms can also be decided by the people? Or if Estonia is currently sending arms? .... I hope I don't sound envious or anything, I just want to understand better what Estonia's position is at the moment.... Fck the war pray for the people, not for the governments. https://news.err.ee/1608512402/estonia-sending-additional-weapons-aid-to-ukraine#:~:text=Estonia%20will%20send%20more%20Javelin,additional%20arms%20assistance%20to%20Ukraine.</p></div>

					<p>🇬🇧 I AM AGAINST WAR. It is shameful, painful and scary for the actions of the Russian government for many years now. Today's events are like a nightmare. And there is not a single person in my environment who would support this crime ... 🇲🇫 JE SUIS CONTRE LA GUERRE. C'est honteux, douloureux et effrayant pour les actions du gouvernement russe depuis de nombreuses années maintenant. Les événements d'aujourd'hui ressemblent à un cauchemar. Et il n'y a pas une seule personne dans mon entourage qui soutiendrait ce crime... 🇷🇺 Я ПРОТИВ ВОЙНЫ.  Стыдно, больно и страшно за действия правительства России на протяжении уже многих лет.  А сегодняшние события как страшный сон.  И нет в моем окружении ни одной человека, который бы поддерживал это преступление...</p></div>

					<p>Can someone help me understand my Russia feels so insecure that it feels it needs to attack another country? I read about NATO, the West surrounding them, etc. But beyond that - why do they feel threatened that former Eastern Bloc countries are NATO members? It's not like anyone wants to attack Russia! In my mind it makes no sense. Can someone help me understand what the reasoning, the fear mindset, behind Putin actions are? Thanks!!!</p></div>

					<p>Dear friends! Unfortunately, the events of the latest weeks and days do not show any de-escalation of the conflict from Russian Federation. From yesterday's speech of Russian president we understood that Russia is not willing to find the ways to resolve the conflict in diplomatic way and proved that all 8 years made a war with us. Russia denies Ukraine as an independent country, Russia denies Ukrainians as a nation. I believe many of you have friends, colleagues, neighbors or classmates who are Ukrainians. I hope Ukrainians showed you what beatiful, positive, smart and hospitable people we are with authentic culture, own history and big hearts. We, Ukrainians, and I believe all world are shocked that in 21 century we can again repeat sad lessons of history. We, simple people,  praying for peace and want stop the war and Russian invasion to Ukraine. Tomorrow ( 23.02) at 5pm near Russian embessy we want to ask for your support and show that we are all against the war. This event is officially organized by Ukrainian community in Estonia 🇺🇦🇺🇦♥️🕊</p></div>

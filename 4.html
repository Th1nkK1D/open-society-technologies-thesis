					<p>Hello expats! I need your attention for awhile. My dear cat Pasha has been missing since yesterday early morning. He is 1,5 years old-male- red cat. Super human friendly creature that has a potential for him to go together with whoever calls. If you see my boy around the Kalamaja region (especially Salme) please remember this post and kindly let me know.  P.s. He has a chip.</p></div>

I am finally arranging my doggo's arrival to Tallinn! 😍 He is more than 8kg so he needs to travel in cargo and due to work, I will not accompany him (he's traveled like this many times before without any issues).

					<p>I’m looking for a reliable Cat sitter when I’m out of the country (19th of December until 31st). Preferably someone who’s experienced with feral cats.  He’s a 3-year old (indoor) rescue from Greece with a lame paw, fully vaccinated and dewormed.  Preferably someone who could take him into their house. He’s scared of children and isn’t used to being around other pets. I’ve seen people recommending Laura (Lemmikuhoidja) unfortunately, I can’t reach her.  I live in Kesklinn. Recommendations welcome.

					<p>With winter coming, my (almost) hairless dog is going to freeze herself to death. Even the floor is too cold for my liking. Do you know where to buy a heated pad/heated mat in Estonia ? Similar as the one in the picture. P.S:  Actual photo is not my dog.  P.S2: I've looked at Amazon and AliExpress, in case I can't find it locally or the price difference is too much I will go there.</p></div>

					<p>Hi I am hoping to get a recommendation for a veterinarian that is preferably centrally located. I just moved to Tallinn (like a day ago so I don't know much about the veterinarians in the area) and my cat is having a lot of difficulty breathing. I am hoping to find someone that will see my cat ASAP.  I used the group search already and so far Tatari is NOT the place to go but I am also dealing with a pet emergency so time is crucial and I would like to find someone that will see him tomorrow. Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>Even tho our Smoot (cat) had lots of fun with this chair as you can see... it is a very comfortable chair and adjustable, so if you have a pet you won't need to worry about they ruining it :D P.S. we are not selling the cat</p></div>

					<p>Hello fellow expats.  I am looking for a photographer to do a family photoshoot.  Our family consists of myself, my wife who is pregnant with our first child, and our 5 dogs.  Clearly, the photographer should be comfortable with animals.  Any recommendations are appreciated.  Any photographers in the group who are interested, please PM to discuss in more detail.</p></div>

					<p>Update: We had this issue with Turkish Airlines and Turkish Cargo. Unfortunately, there's no solution; for now, we will try to get him in the cabin. He's 9 kg and Pekingese. Hey everyone! I have an urgent case about my dog. Has anyone recently traveled to Tallinn with their dog by flight? The agency said that there is an embargo on animal admissions in Tallinn. I found this weird and I asked for written information. Just in case, I would be appreciated it if someone traveling with their dog could contact me 🙏</p></div>

					<p>Hello, dear people There is this little buddy on the left side of a photo. A recently born kitten from Paljassaare, 3 months old. He is quite healthy, especially compared to other cats we took from there, and what he needs now is a new home. Just you know, to be a happy kitty and to make his owners happy :) What I'm looking for now is a temporary shelter home for him until we find owners for him. Any volunteers? It's a nice and easy job that will certainly improve this little guy's life and you can count on help from my side. If you are interested in helping him out or want to know more, reach me out in PM.  Peace pickles,  Nikita.</p></div>

					<p>Hello lovely people. In case you have a dog and occasionally need to drop it for a day or long walk, please, save my contact🙂. I am total dog lover, as I travel a lot cannot afford currently to have one myself. Will not need any money and would be extremely delighted to spend some time with your dog, feed, walk and take care if the timing when you need support works for me too. Thanks 🙏</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone. We are in Greece, flying back to Tallinn tomorrow and last minute the airline changed the plane type and we cannot bring our dog back with us… (we brought her to Greece with us when we came for holiday a few weeks ago). Luckily, she can stay with my family in Greece, but she is very old and I really don’t want her to die away from me (sorry, it sounds melodramatic, but those of you who have a dog might understand). Is there a cargo service that you have used and recommend that can take her from Greece and transport her unaccompanied to Tallinn?</p></div>

					<p>Hello group! I have 2 questions 😁 1) Do you know where can I buy a personalized mouse pad?

					<p>Hello everyone, a dear friend has a young cat who swallowed a plastic toy left around by her kid. The veterinary says it needs an operation that cost 1500€ or the cat risks to die. She also is unemployed. Does anyone knows if there is some kind of help to ask, like a charity veterinary clinic or some other who has lower rates for unemployed or something along those line? If someone knows anything that can help please say so, this young cat's life might depend on it! Thank you all.</p></div>

					<p>Edit: Thanks to Signe I now know that there already is a group for this dog park (Toompargi Koerte Jalutusväljak | Toompark Dog Park | Tallinn, Estonia), so I will delete my 'new' group. Nevertheless, I'm still interested in finding a playmate for my dog! :) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Hi! There is a dog park near to Toompea castle. I’ve talked with many dog owners who had no idea this kind of park even existed, and they loved the idea of taking their pup there. So now there is a group for those people who would like to find their dog a playmate or let others now when they are there so their dog could socialise. I have a 4 month old German Shepherd who’d love to find friendly dogs to play with. So let me know if you’re interested via messages, dog park group or just comment this post. Thank you for your attention.</p></div>

					<p>Is there anyone who would like to adopt this poor kitty?🥺 He's very friendly &amp; had a collar on but today I notice that he doesn't have the collar anymore. I assume that the owner doesn’t want to take his responsibility anymore. He roams around lonely, I think the owner doesn’t care about him. I feed him often &amp; he seems to be very hungry always.</p></div>

					<p>Hello expat community,  my wife and I just arrived in Tallinn and are having a wonderful time of settling in and exploring. We are wondering: is there any such thing as a dog daycare that would provide walks, company and fun with co-canines 2-3 times a week? Our dog is a 12 year old friendly but non neutered rescue, most likely a catahula leopard dog, but perhaps only a weird shepherd labrador mix. Grateful for any hints!</p></div>

					<p>Hi all👋 what is the best way to bring two cats here from UK? Any personal experience? 😣 mu understanding only Air Baltic takes cats and only in cargo? Which is thousands of pounds. Other option is driving them myself which is like 1,5k in petrol alone, any other ways? Thank you</p></div>

					<p>Hello!  Anyone had an experience with https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/ ?  Is it worth the membership fee? And is it realistic to find a catsitter if I need it after 2 weeks for example.</p></div>

					<p>Hi, I'm a dog photographer from Finland and I'm looking for a dog model for photo session near Tallinn. This probably isn't the best group to put this ad on but I have no better options so ... 😅 Photoshoot would be held in Jägala (the waterfall area) next week most likely on Thursday (July 21st) if the weather is good. Photoshoot is free for the dog owner and they will be getting few free photos as a thank you.  I'm looking for an obedient dog who isn't afraid of water. Preferably midsize or big. The dog should be able to stand still and sit still.  If you would be interested or you know someone who would, please comment below preferably with the image of the dog.  More of my photos can be found on my Instagram www.instagram.com/tiiatahvanainen_photography or my website www.tiiatahvanainen.com which is only in Finnish though</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone!  Is there anyone who moved to Estonia with a pet? Me and my wife are about to move Tallinn with our cat. We did all the microchip, vaccination and blood test processes but according to regulations we need to wait three months before we move. Our school will start next month and we don't want to wait or leave our cat for three months. Is there anyone who has experience with moving to EU from a non EU country with a pet?</p></div>

					<p>Hello! Anyone here knows a very good grooming service for pet where they talk English?  My Jonsi needs a nail cut and he became very aggressive in those cases.  Last time I bring him to the vet they didn't properly handle him and ended up crying and hiding for 2 days, my heart broken in 1000 pieces :( Anyone who can suggest me a place where they are very gentle and professional?

It is approximately end of June or beginning of July (5-7 days). DM or leave a comment for more details.  Thanks. We are on Instagram as bouncy_queen_dogs.

They are the best friends in the world, came a long way through struggle of the street life. They are like Inj and Jan - the white one is the calmest cat I've ever met, soft and with incredibly beautiful eyes and the black one is an active, energetic, and caring creature who always comes first for snuggling. If you feel like there is an empty place in your life, these two beauties can be the right fulfillment. Come to meet and chat with them!</p></div>

					<p>A friend of mine is trying to move her German Shepherd from Tallinn to Kenya later this year and is looking for a pet shipping company who could help her ship the dog and do the paperwork. Has anyone on here used a pet shipping company to send animals out of Estonia? I have only ever brought animals in so don't actually know of any companies!!</p></div>

					<p>Another expat approved apartment available within the next couple of weeks. Cats are also welcome! Not sure about other animals, should be fine too (we have two cats, that’s why I can confirm the cats only 😁).  Neighbours are great, the location is perfect for city lovers and there is no furniture in it. I especially love the huge red brick wall that extends throughout the apartment. We’re moving out as we bought a house ✨</p></div>

					<p>Hello wonderful people. I’m looking for a new apartment that allow cats, but I haven’t had any luck so far. So now im turning to Facebook to see if anyone can help. Location would be preferred around kesklinn, Kadriorg or vanalinn. Would prefer rent around 700 or lower  euro (utilities not included) but I’m flexible with both location and rent. If anyone can help me and my cat, I would be very happy. Thanks In advance for any info! 😊</p></div>

Stay safe, stay strong, and support each other. That's how we will win. Much love and hugs. Thank you  --------- Hi there, friends I and my mother, and our cat managed to escape from my beloved city of Kyiv, Ukraine Now we are in Tallinn and looking for a not overpriced apartment, preferably one-bedroom, where owners don't afraid of Ukrainian citizenship, war refugees and pets. It's sad but I've been asked about my status here a dozen times today. Also, I've contacted the help centre but there is still no result, for my regret I'm an IT specialist, quite a normal human being I hope. My mother and a cat are nice, too) Please dm me if you know something Thanks in advance</p></div>

					<p>Hey 👋 Sharing my experience from today. Very often landlords in Estonia don’t allow to have pets or we may also travel a lot. Animal shelters provide a great opportunity to spend time with dogs. Think about this option if you want to go for a walk. They are waiting 🐶🐕🐩 4U.</p></div>

					<p>Hello I need help with pet relocation. I am potentially moving back to the U.S. at the end of March or middle of April. I have three cats that I want to bring with me and I need to find two people who are interested in flying to the U.S. that will accompany the cats. The flight will be with Finnair and they only allow two pets in the cabin per flight, so I will have to book a separate flight for the third cat and person flying with the cat. They also only allow pets that have a person with them (I can't buy two seats and leave one empty and bring two cats by myself).  If anyone is interested in a free one way flight to the U.S. with the caveat that they have to bring one of my cats with them, then let me know. I will be on one of the flights with one of the volunteers but not on the other one. The flight is direct from Helsinki to Dallas. Currently I live in Pärnu. I would prefer that you are a couple or two female friends. And of course you must like cats. Again at the moment this plan is very tentative. Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>Pets have the power to make us feel loved, safe, happy, cared for and many more things. So expect nothing less from the latest exhibition “The Pet Show” at the Fotografiska Tallinn. 25 artists have put on show their photos of pets and their owners. Gerrard Gethings compares cats and their owners with a pinch of  humor. While Martin Usborne puts on show poet hi all series of hunting dogs resting with Spain’s pretty landscapes at the background. In these dark ties the exhibition offers a moment to escape. The display is also suitable for kids.  Ticket to the museum is 15€.  Note that you can put the photo of your own pet on the wall at the museum by posting the picture in social media with a hashtag #fotografiskalemmikud.</p></div>

					<p>UPD: I finally got message from my friend. Situation turned better: the second owner of the dogs will manage to pick them up. And she found people in Ukraine not far from border who can take care about them until this. Thank you so much for support! All the info was very helpful and we got a lot of offers to help from awesome Polish people ❤️ Guys, are there any Poland people? Can you help me with searching for information, please🙏? My friend is fleeing Ukraine with 6 animals. She has her own dog and cat+2 husky and 2 cats of her friend who stack in Crete and can’t come back. She hope to cross Poland border with all the zoo, but have no idea what to do next. She asked me to help find Husky help group in Poland, because her internet connection is bad. Can you please tell me in which groups I can ask help? Or maybe you know someone who can accommodate 2 dogs in Poland?</p></div>

					<p>does any one wants to give home for this special cat ?14.03.2022 В НОВОМ ДОМЕ ❤️ ЛАСКОВЫЙ И ДОБРЫЙ ФИЛИПП СРОЧНО ИЩЕТ ДОМ! Филя был найден в ужасном состоянии. Проделана большая работа про превращению этого настрадавшегося больного котика в здорового и красивого кота. Каким был Филипп на улице можно увидеть на последних фотографиях. Всё это позади, теперь осталось найти ему надежный дом. И как можно скорее, так как из-за особенности рта (у Филиппа всегда торчит язык) ему сложно есть сухой корм и кормить его надо в основном консервой. В общей кошачьей комнате это организовать достаточно сложно. Так же, когда Филипп пьёт воду, у него текут слюни :( В остальном он обычный кот и не требует какого-то специального ухода.  Филипп супер - ласковый и общительный парень. Он очень ценит тепло и хороших людей рядом. Ходит за человеком хвостиком, как собака и не слезает с рук, если у него есть такая возможность ))  Котик обработан от паразитов, чипирован, вакцинирован и кастрирован. Очень ждём предложений дома для Филиппа от ответственных людей. Филипп находится в Таллинне.</p></div>

					<p>Hello!  I am looking for someone that’s willing to look after my dogs on a regal basis as I will be traveling for work and pleasure.  I am hoping to build a relationship with this person so that I can use the same person every time when needed and when available.  I am open to having my 2 dogs staying with the said person or this person staying in our place for the duration. (My dogs do not sleep outside they are house dogs).  If you are interested, let’s chat. Let me know what your rates would be.  Thanks.</p></div>

If you also own a dog, could you please forward me your recommendations for: 1. A veterinarian  2. Any dog walking services  3. A great trainer 4. Pet hotel or boarding service for when on vacation… 5. Anything else that I am not thinking of? Thank you so much in advance - I really appreciate the collective wisdom in this group!</p></div>

					<p>Hello fellow expats! I have a couple of dogs and we are looking for a place to live. All our lives we've been living in a house and now we have to live in an apartment. I just wanted to ask how is to live with dogs in a building? Is it hard? I already know that is better a house for them, I just want to hear some experiences from dog owners living in apartments. Many thanks!  Btw, we have been looking for a house since June but it's harder that it seems (€1500 budget).</p></div>

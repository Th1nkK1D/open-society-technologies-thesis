					<p>Hello beautiful Tallinn. I'm a digital nomad and will be around Tallinn for a couple of weeks/ maybe months. I'm looking for a studio apartment to rent on a monthly basis. What's the best option for a short stay other than Airbnb? All other websites require six month or one year agreement.  Also does anyone stay at Eduard by Larsen and know how their pricing works? And is this place close to the city center? Thanks buddies</p></div>

					<p>Does anyone know about this, and can he/she please explain to me? Up to 33m2, they're paying 15 euros per squaremeter. For the apartments bigger than 33m2, they're paying 12 euros per squaremeter. My question is, for example, let's say there's an apartment which is 34m2. Are they paying (33 x 15 + 1 x 12) or (34 x 12)?</p></div>

					<p>Indeed the fear of Maksuamet is the beginning of wisdom for apartment owners I took all your advice and sent a polite reminder as Fred Holmes suggested, with a gentle promise of "reporting to the authorities within 2days of no action" In 4 days a credit alert made my phone vibrate. The last days in December is just about to get detty!!🛒🛍️✈️🥳 Enjoy the holiday guys😂 I will surely enjoy mine.  Previous post was this  https://www.facebook.com/groups/166477880066544/permalink/5764279360286340/What would you advise and where can I report this? My previous apartment had a deposit sum paid to the owner in cash. The contract particularly stated cash payment. We never had any problems. She had her special book and I had my own records. About 2-3 times, I paid into her account when she had to travel or I was away. So there's bank transfer… More evidence. There's also messaging about 18-20th of every month, when she comes to get her money - "I am coming", "I am here", every month.  On the last day of my stay in the apartment, we got into an argument. She denied having my deposit. She claimed the second month was not paid so it was the month in which my deposit was expended. At last she agreed to pay me a balance after the utility bills had been received and deducted from my deposit sum. We signed each others written statement and took pictures.  It's been 4 months and multiple reminders. Nothing.  She is an old lady and I had a good relationship with her. But I've lost my patience.  It's my money after all. Where can I report this? The police? Or...?</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone, I’m writing to learn about an issue I’ve been having with my landlord. Currently, I’m out of the country and my landlord decided to sell the apartment. He messaged me for a house viewing and I did not approve it as I am away. I informed him that he could bring viewers after 9th of January but I do not want any stranger in my apartment as I am away and have valuable items including confidential documents.  However, he said that he will bring in the viewer regardless basing his argument on an article in our contract. The article is as follows: “ to allow the Owner to check the condition of the Apartment, in case the Owner informed him about that at least 48 hours in advance.” … More</p></div>

					<p>Hi there everyone! Can anyone recommend legal council and/or government agency for disputes with a landlord? Am needing some professional advise as my previous apartment was uninhabitable due to construction hazards :(. The building manager is trying every excuse in the book to blame me, but I have evidence otherwise. Hoping to not lose my deposit just in time for Christmas. Very grateful for any suggestions and/or contacts if you have them. Happy holidays and be safe out there.</p></div>

					<p>Dear all The time has come for me to move out of my cozy nest in Telliskivi, and I would be happy to give the room to the next person. You can move in ASAP.  The room is small but the high ceilings make it feel more spacious and the room is nice and warm. Three other people live in the apartment, and there is also a living room, a bathroom, and a kitchen with everything you need. All the furniture is left in the room, except for the mirror and the clothes rack.   The rent is 154 eur. During the summer months, the rent including utilities is around 200, currently around 300. The deposit is €134. The location is also very good, with a 10-minute walk to Telliskivi creative city and 10 minute bus ride to Vabaduse Väljak. You can let me know if you are interested by sending an e-mail to nora.roosimolder@gmail.com.</p></div>

					<p>Hello there! My husband and I just arrived here in Tallinn last Friday, and we're looking for an apartment for renting long term. We have a budget of up to 500/600 euro including expenses, or so. We're currently staying at an airbnb in Pelguranna. We booked here until Nov 11, but our landlady was very kind with us, and she agreed to extend our stay until Nov 24 if necessary. So that'd be our deadline for moving. We're not looking for anything fancy, obviously. Essentially, it has to be in Tallinn, one or two rooms, and it has to be cozy lol We speak English, Spanish, some Armenian, but sadly no Estonian yet. Thank you so much for your help!</p></div>

					<p>Hi!  We're looking for a new tenant for our apartment in Kadriorg. We've unfortunately had to leave our home of almost 3 years. My son has autism and ADHD and living in the city has become quite dangerous. He has impulsive control problems and for example, something as little as a bee could send him running straight into oncoming traffic. We loved our 3 bedroom apartment in Weizenbergi. Super private and spacious (84.6m²). With a parking place. We rented the apartment unfurnished, but we'd like to pass the 5 wardrobes that we purchased on to the new tenants, as they're too tall for our new house. 1150 € https://www.kv.ee/uuriturule-on-tulnud-4toaline-korter-luksuslikus-3-3464374.html</p></div>

					<p>Hey!   I have a lovely apartment to rent in Põhja-Tallinn, Sõle 5 (5th floor).  It’s very close to Kalamaja and Telliskivi (10-minute walk to Telliskivi  Creative City) but also just a short walk away from the beach and Merimetsa nature area. The apartment has 2 rooms laid out in 44m2 + balcony to the courtyard.  Bedroom is quite spacious, accommodating a bed, closets and even a desk  for home office. Kitchen is well equipped and separate from the living  room area. Bathroom has a bath and a washing machine and the entry is  small, yet functional. If you’re looking for a nice place to live and are able to get the  smallest things done by yourself (e.g change the lightbulb) then let me  know. Rent is 550€ + utilities (90€ summer / 200€ winter).  Available straight away! Nice and quiet, lots of greenery behind the windows. Car(s) can be parked in front of the house.

					<p>Tere! This is a long shot but here it goes.. I am based in Riga but I frequent Tallinn for work. Bit tired of rentals and booked accommodation and would like something more permanent. Is there perhaps someone who goes to Riga often with whom I could "swap" every now and then? Otherwise, do you know of any platform where I could look for such arrangements? Aitah!</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone! I'm Paola, an Italian Master student who will be studying at Tallinn University for the Spring Semester (January/June 2023). I am looking for a small apartment or a single room in a shared apartment near Tallinn University.

					<p>I was checking the conditions to lease a vehicle, in this case directly with Toyota (which uses Swedbank) and a couple of things I was impressed with, that I've never seen before: - The leasing requires a non-optional downpayment of 10-15%?! - At the end of the leasing period, you can exchange the vehicle for a new one by choosing a new vehicle of your choice and finding a buyer for the old vehicle So, leasings here require a downpayment and if you then want a new vehicle at the end of the leasing (a common practice for companies, that's why the leasing exists) you have to find a buyer for the car, which you don't own? Aren't you supposed to simply be given the choice of choosing a new car each X years, and keep paying the monthly lease? And, downpayment? Lease conditions here in Estonia look more like a loan, than a lease. Please correct me if I'm not understanding the conditions on the fineprint.</p></div>

					<p>Info about accomodation  I have really enjoyed living in a community-style flat with different housemates during my gap and university years so I would like to find something somewhat similar to that.  Which area of the city is the nicest/coolest to live in?  Which price should I expect for a single room in a shared flat?  are there any big scam/risks I should be aware of? On which platform do people look for rooms mostly? any extra tip would be immensely appreciated!</p></div>

					<p>Feedback requested please: (if ok to post) Several posts have highlighted difficulties for foreign students (or expats?) in finding rental apartments. I’m exploring investing in an apartment to rent out. First step is gathering info: Which area of Tallinn would suit student needs?  What size is most needed? (1-2 bedrooms?) Top acceptable monthly price? (No idea!!!!) Other? Thank you to anyone giving insights.🙏😄💕  Looking at summer / fall 2023.</p></div>

					<p>Car leasing/loan question: I've been looking at buying a car. I've lived here 2 years, with a steady income during this time, no problems with any bills or anything, and when I apply for a loan/lease, i'm being offered 10-15% interest on the loan. Just wanted to know that am I doing something wrong with my applications, or should I just understand that since I was not born here, i'm too big of a risk for the banks, and just need to buy the car I have cash for? :D</p></div>

Am moving back to Tallinn ( have been here before) next week, and am looking to rent a flat, or possibly share, budget 300-350 a month, excluding utilities, so am obviously not too concerned with living centrally (am familiar with the rent rates).PM me if anyone has any offers.</p></div>

					<p>Hi guys. I'm leaving my Studio in 1 week to my new place and  because of it I'm giving back my Studio. It is located in Herne 11, the studio is pretty cozy and there's space enough for someone who wanna live in peace and close to everything! It's gonna be available from 28 of september and the price is 450 + utilities. The Studio is pretty economic and the bills are always low! The contract is made by Rendin, so there's NO extra deposit. 🙂 In October the apartment will be included in the energy program offered by the Estonian government, so the future tenant will have no problems with energy bills. It is already available to visiting. ⏰ See you</p></div>

					<p>Hi guys. Do you think city24 is reliable for me in using to budget for what I can expect to actually pay for a place when we're ready to move to Tallinn? I ask because some of the past cities I've lived aren't very reliable with the online apartment websites — i.e. in Tbilisi agents will regularly list BS apartments that are photos of hotel rooms etc. so that you get in touch with them and they say "Oh actually, this one's not available but let me show you some other ones we have," and then when I lived in Porto, the rental market was so competitive that most of the online listings were scams. (So I guess I just have inherent distrust of listing sites now) Thanks for the help :)</p></div>

					<p>Ciao! My name is Hamza and I am starting my Masters at EBS. I will be arriving in Tallinn tomorrow for the first time, and I am looking for a long term accommodation. I would like it to near my university and prefer if utilities are included because I have heard they can get a bit out of hand :D my budget is around 300-350 Euros I have booked a hotel till the end of September during which I will hunt for the suitable room or apartment, and can move in, on a days notice. I am a neat freak and will definitely treat it like my own home. I am extremely meticulous when it comes to my place of living and will always strive to make it feel more like 'home' I will be spending most of the day outside… More</p></div>

So, I wanted to let you know that the place will be available from November first week.

					<p>Can a broker demand from the flat owner to pay their expenses, if they did not manage to sell the flat, and contract expired? Expenses include photos, advertising fees, broker working hours. Contract is rather vague and does not list possible expenses, nor is there a cap for them. I have not heard of such practice before, I thought if brokers don't sell the flat, then both parties just separate and that's all. Sometimes there is a fixed fee which is paid at the beginning of the contract and the broker keeps it if the flat isn't sold. But this....</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone! I have rented a room for a free time space in Tallinn Kesklinn, it's going to be multi purpose, but one central part would be climbing classes for small kids, since we are a climbing company. I'm looking for a team of volunteers to help arrange it in exchange of free entrances once it's up and running. https://www.koalatallinn.ee/volunteer The renovation can start only a little later, and will end around October, but once we get the room clean, we can start the classes on a pop-up wall. To understand whether you are going to be interested in using the space, here's some of its features: - 5 mins walk from Solaris and Stockman, near Lembitu park with a children's playground -… More</p></div>

					<p>I’d like to share a little chart published yesterday by kv.ee about the current situation in local rental market. Great to compare if you’re over- or underpaying and what is to expect in your area. It does not consider the size or condition of the unit, but it should be quite accurate about the overall average. It shows how the number of vacant rental units listed in kv.ee have changed comparing July 2021/July 2022 and what has happened to the price per sqm as well. Please not that this is about July, that is a sleepy month in Tallinn. August and September are hot in here. https://www.kinnisvaraweb.ee/blog/kv-ee-uurihinnad-jatkavad-marssi-tousu-suunas/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss</p></div>

					<p>A reminder to new comers!!!! As a victim of “my landlord sold the apartment without informing me, now I’m homeless” . P.s. I’m the tenet. I rent. Not buy. Actually writing to remind myself. 1. NEVER PAY before ARRIVAL IN ESTONIA  2. Always helpful to read property law, and add stuff to protect yourself in the lease 3. Don’t trust blindly. Even if it’s listed in a university’s website list. They just gathered information, that guarantees nothing. Look for paper evidence, those who claimed to be the owner might be scammers 4. Always trust the expat community. And help each other.</p></div>

					<p>🥺🥺❤️ thanks for your advice! Although it was an unfortunate situation but that brought you to me. I’m still lucky im not alone in this. -------original-------- Guys I’m frustrated. Please help….I’m an international student. And I’m not in Tallinn at the moment. However I looked for an apartment already.  *it is called 1home Estonia* https://1home.eu/ I checked on Reddit before, someone said it was decent. Maybe I was wrong. I’ve paid the deposit online, without flying to Estonia at all. Few months ago. They took my money, and now it’s ONE WEEK BEFORE MY FLIGHT. I was informed that the apartment was sold and no accommodation for me. Waiting for EUR558 refund. For people who searched it on google and want to know what happened:  https://youtu.be/9Xkxl2uctBw</p></div>

					<p>Hello, I am looking for someone to clean my apartment. I'm returning the apartment next Wednesday. And I wish it was nickel. The apartment is a 3-room apartment of 67 square meters. There are the windows and the fridge to clean and the kitchen worktop. No risk for the windows, they overlook a terrace. I estimate the work at around 2 hours (to clean this apartment every week, it is already clean). The apartment is located in Haabersti, Soodi Street. Do you have contacts please? What hourly rate? Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>UPD Hello everyone 😊 I am here for an apartment search for a short term rent 🙏 Maybe someone knows someone or has a suggestion where else to search except for city24 and airbnb.  My friend is coming to Tallinn with her family (two adults and two kids), they are searching for a place to stay for a week in the end of July preferably in the city center. Budget: they found an option on Airbnb for 550 eur for one week. I told her it’s monthly price for an apartment in Tallinn, however we both understand short term rent is usually more expensive, but I am not sure this price is usual. If anyone has any experience with short term rent, please let me know the reasonable price.  Please let me know if you can help with search 😊 Thanks a lot!</p></div>

					<p>[Renting practices in Estonia] Hi all, A practical question here: When delivering a deposit to a private owner for apartment reservation, is there a practice to write a statement by hand confirming the received deposit (date, place, signature and all)? This is usually done in my home country, one statement for the owner, one for the renter. Also, it can be added that if the owner gives up on the renting, deposit is returned to the renter. In the opposite situation, the deposit stays with the owner.  Relevant advice is welcomed! Aitäh!</p></div>

					<p>Hello, I would like to rent a cabin in the woods for a weekend or a little longer. I tried to search online, but the only things I find is fancy stuff for 250 EUR a night (for a fancy stay) or 80 EUR a night (for a literal s-h-i-t-h-o-l-e). So now, I'm trying to tap into the hive mind  of the community. 😀  In case someone knows someone who know someone who has a cabin in the woods and don't want a kidney for a 3-5 days rent.</p></div>

					<p>Hi all.  I am in the process of agreeing to a contract on a house rental.  The contact will be ready next week but I need to fly back to The Netherlands tmrw.  It was suggested we can sign these digitally in the interim and then exchange hard copies when I fly back with the move.  Is this a common practice in Estonia? I of course will not transfer any funds before the owner signs as well.  The owner is on holidays which complicates the logistics of getting physical copies signed while I’m still here.  Shady or legit?</p></div>

					<p>Tere, We are looking at relocating to Estonia to be closer to my girlfriends family. We are after a plot around 50,000m2 with a cost of no more than €60,000. The living area doesn't have to be new, need of renovation is fine, maybe better. Ideally we would like to be in Läänemaa or north of Pärnumaa. Please get in touch if you know of any property or land for sale that would suit.</p></div>

					<p>I will preface this post with a short background.  I have lived in Estonia for the past 29 years.  Have done real estate for 11.  I know that most people in this group hate real estate agents and have heard your reasons why, and I will not argue with anyone on their individual experiences.  Everyone has different experiences and throughout the years I have really tried not to be "that agent".   I recently moved back to the USA, but am partnering with my former boss at RE/MAX, to sell an apartment owned by one of my long-time clients and friends - who are also ex-pats and are in this group. (So please no nasty comments - some of you have made some of my owners feel really bad in the past).  … More</p></div>

					<p>In Tallinn atm the rental prices are not determined based on location, demand, amenities. It is determined by the monthly mortgage/loan payments of the landlord.  Birdbox with a single bed and a tap in a noname locality? - 600EUR!  Take it or leave it!</p></div>

					<p>Dear "friends",  I am currently in search for accommodation due to my landlord increasing current price by 25% which I think if overkill and not justified. My budget range is 350 - 400, I'm fine with 450 as well (excluding utility bills). Ideally from owner and no "box" or "cozy" apartments.  Any recommendations? Thanks in advance. &lt;3</p></div>

					<p>I'm renting out my one bedroom apartment next to Liivalaia street so between old town and Veerenni. 43m2 in a wooden house with original floors that squeak. I built it for myself, not to rent out, but it's too small for a family. Currently no sofa or dining table, but can provide them if needed. Nice neighbours and totally fine to work from home (high speed internet!). No pets allowed.  Solaris, Wise and Bolt are all less than 800 m. Message me if interested :)</p></div>

I know someone who is looking for new tenants from August, so here's the ad if interested: https://www.kv.ee/nb-korter-vabaneb-31-07-2022sinu-voimalus-linnas-m-3335414.html.

					<p>Hello everyone ! We have a nice little house in Kriistine neighborhood, but we won't be there from 1st of July till 15th of August.  If anyone is interested of renting a place for summer, that could match very well.  The house is 46 square meter (with one bedroom), fully equipped, lightfull, and has a very nice garden.  So the full house is shared but this part is totally independent, let's say it's a private apartment inside a shared building  The price for this month and half would be 600€ If interested, you can contact me or Shaya Ghp with PM  Good day to all :)</p></div>

But I have also met apartment owners who speak English and stilll didn't find me worthy to stay at their place.</p></div>

					<p>Question about war or covid-related cancellation clauses in your apartment rental contracts:  What conditions have landlords outlined in case for example the Estonian government or the person's home government officially says "high level of danger, we recommend all nationals to return home."  I would imagine most likely you don't get reimbursed the current month's rent (because you've already paid it the end of the previous month), and perhaps you would not get the deposit back. What options have landlords given? Curious to hear differnet force majeure clauses. Thanks in advance</p></div>

					<p>Hi, My name is Rickard, I'll be 33 years old this year, I come from Sweden. I will soon be moving to Tallinn for a job, I will be working in Ülemiste City. I have a contact in Tallinn already and I have previously lived in eastern Europe (2013-2017 in Poland) I m also used to long, cold and dark winters so I at least think I know somewhat what I am getting myself into. I've heard good things about the neighborhoods Kadriorg and Pöhja-Tallinn. Can you recommend any other neighborhoods? I'm looking to rent a studio/small apartment. As I understand it this should be reasonable at 4-500€ excluding bills?  Looking forward to get to know Tallinn better! Regards  RIckard</p></div>

					<p>Picking everyone's brain here. I'm just on the verge of signing a contract for an apartment in Tallinn. One of the clauses there in the contract is In addition to the Rental Price, the Lessee shall also pay the Additional Expenses related to use of the Residential Space and maintenance and improvementcosts of the building, including the following: Power supply expenses, water supply and drainagesystem expenses, heating supply expenses,administrative fees, maintenance fees, emergencyrepair expenses, garbage removal fees, generalCleaning fees, Internet connection and telephoneservice fees, TV fees, security fees, repair fund, parts of loan payments of Apartment Association In my opinion the tenant should not be paying for the emergency fund, repair fund or loan payments. The rest are fine. This is the landlords responsibility as it increases or maintains his apartment investment and value. Am I being too picky here? What if they decide to re-tar the toad and add 100€ to the bills.  Any thoughts</p></div>

I’m looking for a new apartment/house and I’ve went on a few websites (https://www.remax.ee , https://www.city24.ee etc… )and it seems that the price from website to website varies a lot, what should I expect in term of pricing per square meter if I buy/rent in Tallinn?  2. What are the best website to look for an apartment/house in Tallinn? Is it better to go through a real estate agency? How quickly can you move in a new apartment? 3. How has the housing market evolved in Tallinn? Is it better to rent or to buy in the current… More</p></div>

					<p>Hi dear expat community! A bit of a different question.... Do you know someone in Berlin? Or maybe are you from there? Long story short, a very dear friend got a job there, but it seems that it is easier to win the lottery than find a place to live. The company she is working for got her a month in an apartment, but that time is now gone. The room she managed to find, end it up not working out. She's now living in a hotel and desperate to find something, as hotel life is not affordable in the long run. Any help/idea is very much appreciated. PS: she is in all the FB groups she could find... TIA ☺️</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone 🙂 I have a question regarding the tenant protection in Estonia (if there is any). I’ve been living here for almost 9 months now and I have been paying a decent rent for my place now. However, my landlady now decided to raise the rent by 100€ at once. This notice came today (20.05.2022) and I have to make a decision in three days until the 23.05.2022.  The rent increase will take effect at 01.07.2022. My question is, if these kind of rent increases are legal? (Because they’re definitely not in my home country) Thank you!</p></div>

					<p>Hi there peeps, I need some assistance from those of you who have bought a house as an expat. We currently want to buy a property, but the broker wants a booking fee of 4000. This is concerning to me as the 'contract' says that if we do not sign a contract of sale with the seller by 18 June we will forfeit the booking fee (unless it is due to something out of our control). What are your experiences with this? Did anyone need to give a booking fee? Was it this much? Did you get it back or lose it?</p></div>

					<p>Hello, Does anyone here has experience renting the apartment for just a couple of months? Me and my husband need spacious 1-2 bedroom apartment for 2 months - June-July - but City24 and KV seem to only have long-term options, and Airbnb are mostly renting by days/weeks. Would be grateful if anyone could recommend where else I could search, maybe there are some other agencies/websites? (I’m already signed up to Facebook Korterite Üürimine group) Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>UPDATE: Since there has been so much interest in this place, I'm pausing this ad for now and hopefully will find the right person. :)  Hey! If you're looking to rent an apartment or know someone who needs one, you might find this post valuable. If you're settled, keep scrolling. :) I happen to have an apartment to rent in Mustamäe - Ehitajate tee 40 (1st floor). Very close to TTÜ and Technopol, literally next to recently opened Männi park, and across the street from Mustamäe Spa. It has 2 rooms laid out in 45.6m2. 1 bedroom, semi-open kitchen/living area, nice bathroom, and a small functional entry. If you're looking for a place to rent and are able to get the smallest things done by yourself (e.g change the lightbulb) then let me know. Rent is 450€pm + utilities (50-60€ summer / 100-140€ winter). Neighbors are decent and car(s) can be parked in front of the house. Pictures: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rbk1SXakH01QX87Bvy5xHce2AFcnXhzv?usp=sharing Available from June.</p></div>

					<p>With a heavy heart, we had to leave the best apartment we ever had. A TRUE "Covid Special" as they say. In 2020, Due to covid, luxury hotels were really suffering and rental prices were crashing big time. This made it possible for us to find a very large apartment right above of Viru Keskus shopping mall. It was above the central Tram station, the bus station, and basically the heart of the city, right beside old town. If I wanted a supermarket, shop, gym, pretty much anything, all I had to do was take the elevator. Guests could use the malls parking lot for free (for the first 30 minutes). This made getting a taxi, a lift from a friend, or even having something dropped off/picked up,… More</p></div>

					<p>Tere everyone! I'm Maro, 34 years old and I'm originally from Middle East. I am relocating to Tallinn in May for work and will stay the first month in Airbnb till I have a suitable housing. I used to live in South east Asia for almost 15 years. I am a structured and well organised person. I spend most of the time at home however given this relocation step, I would be exploring the city of Tallinn in the first few months. I am looking to move in to my long term apartment ideally by 1 June, it would be only me. Hope I can hear from you soon. If you need any extra information, please let me know. Preferred locations: Kesklinn, Kristiine, Kadriorg, Kalamaja Nice to have: balcony, ground/first floor Budget: 400-550</p></div>

					<p>FOR SALE! Hi guys! A friend is selling his cute apartment at Faelhmani 8. It was meant to be a 2-bedroom one, but actually it is a very spacious studio apartment of 78 sq.m. surrounded by an own terrace of 52 sq.m. with a winter garden. In its current condition it is perfect for a single person or a couple, but it is possible to restore walls to make more private spaces in it. Summer bills are about 70-80 euros, winter ones around 150 euros thanks to the gas heating of the whole building. There's no storage room, but there's a garage space (is on sale separately for 20k). The price is 340k, there's an option to buy it with furniture. There're no agents or brokers involved, and it has not been yet published on major real estate resources. Send me a PM if you'd like to see it in person, I'll open it for you. No agents please!  P.S. It is not available for rent, because a new house urgently needs investments.</p></div>

					<p>Hello folks, I will be looking for an apartment (preferably)/room to move in somewhen in August-September this year.  Mb you know you will move out at that period of time? I have started looking early because I want to find a place which is close to tram n.4 stop or just good and fast commute to Ulemiste business center, +- 450€ (without utilities). For a long term rent.  Since it narrows down the search a lot, I hope to find smth in advance before the opportunity slips away from me. 🤪 Mb it is not how people look for the place here, but I would love to get smth I am looking for rather than adjusting to the offers on the market at the moment when I actually need a place.  Fingers crossed 🤞and thanks in advance.</p></div>

					<p>Another try to find an apartment in Tallinn 🙂 Hi everyone! My name is Olga and I’m Ukrainian. I’d lived in Estonia for 3 years. Every summer I’m coming back to Estonia  and would love to come this year too. I have close friends in Tallinn who are actively involved in volunteering work. I consider moving to Tallinn from May and help them not only remotely but at the spot. I’m looking for an apartment (1-2 bedrooms) starting from May for 3-4 months (maybe longer). I’ll be happy to rent bigger place to be able to host people from Ukraine who need some time for adaptation before renting their place.  Please PM if you have an apartment to rent out or if you know a person who leaves Tallinn for summer and willing to rent the place. Price is matter of negotiation.  Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone!  There was a fire yesterday at one of the residential buildings on Pae street, where my amazing music teacher lived. It started out as a fire in one of the neighbor’s apartments and it escalated to all of the apartments nearby.  They were only able to grab some of the documents and a couple of other things, but otherwise everything would have to be purchased again.  Any help will be very appreciated here. If you have any items (toys, household goods) you can give, please DM me. Her account is Stepan Solodkov EE 72200221066235711 ♥️ If you have any recommendations for where they can live, please also let me know!  Thank you so much ❤️</p></div>

					<p>Can anyone explain me what is the point of paying a brooker fee for an apartment you find online? I've lived in different countries and it's the first time I am encountering this request. I'd understand if it would be paying someone's effort in finding you an apartment, but if you find it yourself online, what is the point of that? Side note, looking for a 3 rooms apartment starting July or September, if anyone can help :)</p></div>

					<p>My wife and I are moving to Tallinn for 12-24 months in July. We are unsure of apartment versus house living in this city but happy to consider both - can anyone recommend good neighbourhoods to live? Preference is to live within 15 - 20 minutes drive or so to the city, it’s just the two of us.  I will be working in the Juhkentali area of Tallinn. My wife will not be Working and without kids so access to cafes and social activities will be important for us. Thank you in advance.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone! My name is Olga and I’m Ukrainian. I'd lived in Estonia for 3 years. Every summer I’m coming back to Estonia  and would love to come this year too. I have close friends in Tallinn who are actively involved in volunteering work. I consider moving to Tallinn from May and help them not only remotely but at the spot. I’m looking for an apartment (1-2 bedrooms) starting from May for 3-4 months (maybe longer). I’ll be happy to rent bigger place to be able to host people from Ukraine who need some time for adaptation before renting their place.  Please PM if you have an apartment to rent out or if you know a person who leaves Tallinn for summer and willing to rent the place.  Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>Any remote work fans here? If you want to book a flexible workspace for a day (or a few hours), there’s now a platform for it. Check out all the workspaces that are already available in Tallinn and there’s more to come - https://ruum.work/?category=tallinn  Why? * a dedicated workspace * no need to keep ordering coffee to justify your stay * no weird looks from the staff * file it as a business expense * support local businesses * better mental health (home office isolation can be brutal) * flexible, no long-term commitment</p></div>

					<p>We want to terminate a residential lease contract 2 months before its end (we told our landlord that we want to move out in two or three weeks). First, because the new utility bill is incredibly high (500€ instead of 200€), second, because our salary got reduced by 30%, so we can't afford the apartment anymore. There's another reason though: we decided to live in two different apartments with my girlfriend instead of this one.  The landlord doesn't want to return the safety deposit only because we want to terminate it earlier, he thinks he's allowed to have a compensation for that. Although in the contract the reasons for not returning the deposit are those regarding the damages of the property, not a word about compensation for early termination. In the contract it says that any side can terminate the contract for a good reason without any time for a warning. Can our reasons be considered as good reasons by Estonian law of obligations? Apparently the landlord doesn't think so, while we do. Thank you in advance.</p></div>

					<p>Hello! Is anyone living in Kalamaja and planning on being away in the month of MAY and interested in renting out their flat/studio  for that month (or at least for several weeks in the month of May?). I’m having a baby at the beginning of May and my mother in law is coming from the US for almost a whole month to help out, but since we don’t have a guest room she’d need a little place to herself (mainly to sleep, since the rest of the day she’ll be at my place). There are not many options on airbnb for those dates that are very close to my flat (Niine street) so I thought it would be worth a shot to ask here.  If you have something close-by to sublet for that month, please PM me 🙂  Thanks and happy Sunday!</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone! I'll move to Tallinn this March and I'm excited for the life I'll experience in Estonia. Currently I'm planning my finances for the following years, and I'm bugged by the fact that a significant portion of my income will be spent for rent. Given that mortgage price is lower than rent, is it a good strategy to quickly apply for apartment mortgage? Is this option possible for foreigner with temporary residence permit, and what are the legal challenges and best practices to own a property in Tallinn? Last, do you guys happen to know area (maybe suburbs?) that have cheap property price, but good access to the city centre and have the potential to reach significantly higher price in the next decade? If you're a property owner in Estonia and willing to share some insights about this, let's hangout later! :D Thank you.</p></div>

					<p>Hello dear expats and locals, I just received an email from my landlord that he will restructure his loans on the apartment and a real estate agent will visit the apartment, and added that if they won't reach me they will use the spare keys to enter the apartment. Will you please give information if they can enter the apartment without my consent? Is it even legal to violate my privacy?</p></div>

					<p>Hi We're going out of town for 2 weeks in February[7th to 20th] and need someone who can come take care of our baby, Kobe,  at least once a day. He is very very naughty and playful but also needs a lot of loving.  I will pay you for this ofcourse.  And all supplies will be available for him.   A pet hotel is the last option - Kobe recently moved to us and we don't want to stress him out again by leaving him at another new place.   DM if interested. Location is city centre - 7 mins walk from Stockmann.</p></div>

					<p>Hi all, i’ve just joined the group as we’re planning to move to Tallinn in a few months ♥️ We’re already looking at apartments online (don’t know yet about the family-friendly areas, just checkin’) There’s only one thing that keeps me from the final decision: the endless nights in winter. Could you share some experiences about how you cope with 9AM sunrise and 3PM sunset? Our daughter is seven, so she’ll go to (international) school every morning. I guess she’ll take the darkness easier than me :)  Thanks a lot!</p></div>

					<p>Has anyone obtained a mortgage/home loan as a resident but when owning overseas rental property that has a large mortgage on it and large mortgage payments? I know that some lenders don't mind too much and take into account the rental income to evaluate affordability while some don't. Has anyone in the same situation applied for an Estonian mortgage? Basically I need to know if, say an existing 1000 euro monthly mortgage payment will reduce the amount of money I can borrow by that moment or if that payment can be partially offset by rent received.</p></div>

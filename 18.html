					<p>Good morning everyone, I thought I'd share a fantastic recipe created by a group of Canadian Prarie farm ladies, their bran muffins can't be beaten. 🌤 P.S. I use oat bran that I purchase through Amazon de, And the buttermilk can be substituted with 946 ml of whole milk plus 3 tablespoons of lemon 🍋 mixed in. Pps. The batter lasts up to three weeks in the fridge, which means you can have fresh baked muffins whenever you want.</p></div>

					<p>Two weeks ago I asked for recommendations for a great place to get birthday cake, thank you all for your recommendations, I ended up going with Denise Cunha who made me the best Brazilian birthday cake plus some individually packed cake for all my guests. I recommend her to anyone having a party anytime soon.</p></div>

					<p>Random question but has anyone found a brand of pre-made seljanka that is semi-good quality in some supermarket? I always see those jars and I'm curious if some of the brands is semi decent or even properly tasty.  (Yes, i know i can cook it on my own, I also know some restaurants have really good ones, but that's not where the question is oriented :) )</p></div>

					<p>Hi! I do not really make recommendations for services but for Clean Kitchen I want to make an exception. We just received our first delivery and prepared our first day. Just wow, its a lot of food for just two people and super easy to make and taste amazing. Only downside is that the recipe card is in estonian (not sure if they provide english), google translate worked fine.  For those that do not know what to cook or hate doing groceries - use clean kitchen as it saves a lot of time and seems to be cheap too!</p></div>

					<p>After a lot of request, we have added bun kebabs in our menu for Kristiine backyard cafe day on 27th of August (this saturday) 1100-1500 at Siidisaba 5. Bun kebabs in Pakistan are the direct competition to Vara pau in Bombay (Mumbai) that looks like a burger but looks can be deceiving 😈. Its an underdog in his own class! Some of the ingredients are: beef, chickpea lentils, eggs, cilantro, mint, green chilis, special chutney, onions, tomato and cucumber. I dare you to visit us at Siidisaba 5 on this Saturday and try the true taste of streets of Karachi and Bombay (again, Mumbai. My mother don't allow me to call it Mumbai still. She is from M...Bombay)</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone, I hope you’re having a lovely day🙂 We're running the TLU student podcast and our discussion is “Should you become a Vegan?” and also talking about its impact on nutrition. We’re looking for vegans who are willing to be guest speakers on this episode of the Podcast. We intend to record between the 27th and 30th of April, so I agree we are on a very strained timeline 🥶. Please let me know in the comment section if anyone is interested and I’ll share the full details🥺. Here is a link to our podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0TRMsX71Y5zwClgqNq907y?si=2vYKNcrjSDy_F5mQq7i3RQ The episode would be live📡 at the end of April and It would be an honour and privilege to have vegans on the episode for a balanced discussion🙏🏽. Looking forward to your responses. - Thanks in advance🤞🏽</p></div>

					<p>A very off topic question but am I just blind or is there no supermarket here that offers flavored/sweetened creamers or even condensed milk? I've been to Prisma, Selver, Rimi etc. And none of them have anything besides the plain 10% creamer.  Of course, I may just not have waved my phone with Google translate enough to notice it but I would be glad if someone let me know a place I could find anything of the sort.</p></div>

					<p>Am I the only one who felt badly the poorest  service of KFC here in Tallinn. In Dubai KFC provide a complete meal decently  with free paper plates Fries , coleslaw drinks ,sauces and lot of  buns . Here they give only bucket without any basic  accessories . There free drink refill is also pathetic water and sugar with no gas and taste. It feels so embarrassing  how they present food a bucket in a tray with mostly cold fries and chicken  and thats all.  No plates no spoon no extra glass no sauce but tiny paid one  , no coleslaw  no buns nothing . Will they ever do their quality better as per international  standard.  Or they always earn here for their name only</p></div>

					<p>Hello all. The cake lady is back again for another sweet weekend.  As some might know already, I am backing a new cake that I chose, every weekend, and I will be giving it away each Sunday to the first person who requests it during the week. I ask for a small fee of 2€ per cake, simply for covering some of the basic ingredients, the cardboard box, and to lock that cake for you. I am not able to do home delivery, so you would have to come and pick it up (city center, close to Viru Keskus).  Why am I doing this? https://www.facebook.com/groups/166477880066544/permalink/4746673485380271 I only request one thing in return from those who do take each cake home. Constructive feedback. I want to… MoreHello all, I have a dream, where I would be able to bring my love for baking into people's lives. Baking is one of my happiest moments and is where I love to spend my free time. However, I have not been able to do it as often as I would wish for, then we would have a whole new cake at home and we just can't consume as many cakes as I would love to… More bake :D For that reason, I'd love to share this love with you all. Here's my proposal: Every weekend I will be baking a new cake chosen by me and I will be giving it away each Sunday to the first person who requests it during the week. I will be asking a small fee of 2€ per cake, simply for covering some of the basic ingredients, the cardboard box,… More</p></div>

					<p>Where can I buy malt powder? (Malted milk or malt powder is a powdered gruel made from a mixture of malted barley, wheat flour, and evaporated whole milk powder. The powder is used to add its distinctive flavor to beverages and other foods, but it is also used in baking to help dough cook properly.)</p></div>

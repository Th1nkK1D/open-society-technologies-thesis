					<p>Hey, fellows, hope all is good with you, and happy upcoming new year. One question: is one allowed to work at multiple jobs at the same time in Estonia? Like let‚Äôs say I work for company X but got offer from company Y and I see that it‚Äôs possible to carry on both time and resourcewise. And company Y allows to do that, but not sure about X.  I found a quote on workinestonia.com which says that ‚ÄúIf you have a temporary residence permit for employment, and you keep fulfilling the conditions (keep working for the same employer, at the same position, and meeting all the requirements) of your residence permit then you can hold multiple positions simultaneously.‚Äù  So, technically it‚Äôs legally possible but I would like input from someone if they‚Äôre an HR representative or has legal knowledge about this sort of stuff or someone who has done this before. Thanks beforehand.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone!  Do you know if it is allowed to travel with ID card (temporary residence permit) only without passport to other EU country, if I am not an EU citizen. I am Ukrainian and we have visa-free regime with EU. I am asking because I consider going to Austria with my daughter to see our family, however, my daughter‚Äôs passport expired a week ago and I‚Äôm late to do the new one before New Year. So I wonder if I can use TRP instead of passport for traveling. Can anyone advise me on the above? üôè</p></div>

					<p>Hi ladies, has anyone received the Estonia digital nomad visa? I‚Äôve been holding out to apply for the Portuguese digital nomad visa but feel the Estonian one could be an easier process (also not having to go back to the states or Australia to apply or deal with Portugal‚Äôs extremely backlogged immigration department.) After going through the arduous/not worth it process of the Spanish autonomo visa last year, feel like opting for the easiest visa route possible. Would love to hear of anyone‚Äôs experiences!</p></div>

					<p>Good evening for all üòä My wife and I just arrived yesterday to Estonia and we got out of the airport without even being asked a single question by the police or a border official. Is that normal? We were only asked about any good to declare but when it comes to our visit here, nobody ask anything. We are wondering if we mistakenly avoid any control or it is just the normal procedure for people arriving the country. Should we go to the Police and Border office to notify our entrance or something?  Thank you all in advance</p></div>

But a couple of weird things happened. 1 - When we applied for visas , I got 1 year and my wife got 6 months, and they told us to submit her ‚Äúbank statement‚Äù with sufficient funds for her stay. This was super weird as she is applying for spouse visa based on my work visa . Felt really like some kind of discrimination or Sth. Anyway we did end of getting visas. 2 - We applied for residence permit as well. After almost two months , I received an email saying that they‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone ! Since May of this year, there has been a lot of buzz going around with regards to the 5 year temporary residence permit extension for students. Rumors are that immigration authorities are not going to extend it for 5 years anymore (after graduating) rather make it according to the job contract (if only sponsored). I also came across many people who were kicked outta estonia or those who were lucky got only 1 year extention. Is this all true ? I tried to look for some info on TRP extensions but in the govt websites, its not mentioned that it's been slashed from 5 to 1 2 or 3 years. I'm so curious rn because my trp is going to finish along with my studies and i dont wanna go back to Dubai yet, need some time to stay here till i figure out a next move. If you wonderful people have any info on this situation, please let me know ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p></div>

					<p>Hello, did anyone here apply for their ID card recently? Did you get yours already? I applied for mine more than 8 weeks ago and still didn't hear back from them. They said it'd be done in 30 days, but when I called them a few weeks ago, they said maybe 2 months, so I'm worried. Phone lines aren't really helpful and I don't know if it's worth it to go there and wait in the hour-long line again, just to be told to wait longer. Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>Hello everyone! Hope you started your week very well. I have a question about the residence permit and visa appointments. I recently got hired by a company in Estonia and I'll be moving with my wife. The company already took care of booking the appointments for both residence permit and d-visa. My question is: Does anyone knows if I can be there as my wife's translator? Her English is good for understanding but she needs some practice in order to speak fluently and I am afraid that she may get stuck or something during the appointment. Would you say that could be a problem? Thank you all in advance üòä</p></div>

He applied bolt food, but he does not know how to pay his tax because he could not open a bank account yet. He is in Estonia with a D type visa.  The fee will be deposited into the his revolut account.  And other question is that there is a cash payment method in Bolt food?

					<p>Hey! A question to the Russian citizens - is there anyone here who applied for a permanent residence permit this year (without having Estonian relatives)? Have you got it? *My time to apply comes only in 7 months, but I'm just a bit anxious and I need some reassurance, so any positive experience would make me a little bit calmer* P.

					<p>So I'm in need of some help with getting a residency permit. I just graduated from Tallinn University and now I'm looking for a job. Since I'm not a student any more I have to go through the whole process again from scratch. However I've run into some weird problems maybe someone can help me with. I was told that the only way to get a residency permit (without going back to school of course) was through getting a job and having the business send approval to the police, sure easy enough.  At this point I've found a job I'm happy with and they are very willing to hire me. However now things get unusual.

I am prospective student at Taltech and Today I got the very unfortunate email about my study visa decision as it was refused due to "Visa Officer is not satisfied that I will leave the country after my studies" I contacted to the University about the decision and they said they can't do any thing. Can you please suggest me what should I do, in case if I go for appeal how many chances that decision will be change. Thanks!</p></div>

					<p>Hi, I recently got my permanent residence permit, I am divorced and I have two children. My mom back home is getting more and more sick and sad that I left her and I decided to move to Estonia 5 years ago. I did a terrible mistake by leaving in the first place, the situation is irrepairable and it is causing me all kinds of stress and depression and overweight and bad immunity system. The choice is very tough between leaving my children or abondoning my mom. I would like to be able to live between Estonia and my home country as I am not able to make such a tough decision. How can I do so and at the same time not loosing my permanent residence permit? Thank you for your time.</p></div>

					<p>Can anyone recommend someone that I can talk to (willing to pay$) about all the requirements for living part time in Estonia? I am married to an Estonian. We jointly own an apartment in Estonia. My wife and child will be moving permanently to Estonia (both Estonians). I want to split my time between the states and Estonia (with a US employer).  I have read quite a bit on all this, but it is all clear as mud, especially around spouses of Estonians. Thx!</p></div>

					<p>Update: thanks a lot for your support! Help is on the way! Hello. Need help urgently! Can any one in Kalamaja, please, come and help us to disassemble some firnuture (two beds, two nightstands, one chair, one table)? Estonia at the last minute denied our visa applications (despite my husband already working here!), so it turned out that we had a few days to leave the EU. We need to clean the apartment by tomorrow morning, but it seems that we will not be able to finish everything on time. Have all the tools. We'll be happy to give you some cash. Or we have winter tyres which we wanted to sell, Peg Perego buster in good condition, kids books or food :)))</p></div>

					<p>Hi all! Wanted to ask if any of you have had following experience: I have a friend who is in the same sex partnership and they would like to get married in Estonia for her to get a permanent resident/ citizenship as she is from a very diplomatically doomed country. She herself has been living and studying here for four years already and knows Estonian, works full time and has been fully integrated.  What kind of problems/ issues they might face and is it even possible?  Any advice would be highly appreciated!</p></div>

					<p>Hello Everyone, I am a Tunisian, I was working as a software engineer. I got a job offer from en estonian company, I accepted and started the relocation process.  Well, after more than a month in turkey where I need to apply for the Visa (cause: lack of estonian consulat or embassy in Tunisia) the employer decided to drop the contract and the whole process. They were in charge of relocation fees (Hotel in Turkey, flight from Tunisia to Ankara &amp; Ankara to Tallin). And they still saying they will pay for all of that. My question is : for me I lost my job because of this promess, and I didn't work one month. Till I find my next job , it will take at least one or two months. Is there any law that can help me at least get some indemnities for my losses ? Thank you in advance for your answers</p></div>

					<p>I have recently moved to Estonia. My wife is a student here with her residency and I am here on a D visa looking for work. I have applied to several jobs and am waiting but in the meantime I am wondering if it's possible to be a bolt driver. We have a car. Anyone know if this qualifies me for a work visa or can I do it on a D visa? About how much do they make? Not as a delivery but as a taxi.</p></div>

					<p>Hi all! The husband and I had an appointment at the PPA office in Tartu to deal with his immigration process. Long story short, we had a truly horrible experience - the agent refused to speak to him (like she barely acknowledged he was there), and only talked to me. When I say talked, I mean yelled. She was not happy with the paperwork, the way we had done things, the way I had filled out my part, the way my husband stood in line to take his picture... Instead of explaining how she wanted things done, though, she just belittled and berated me. And this was our second time filling all this out, we did it the same way in Tallinn and had no issues.  While there, we also noticed other immigrants‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>I'm British, and my temporary residence card runs out in the summer.  I mailed the Estonian Police Migration Advice address, and heard:   "As long as your place of residence is registered in Estonia at the population register, your temporary right of residence will be valid. This means that if your place of residence is registered in Estonia after your current ID-card expires, you will just need to apply for a new card" But, I can't go to the online renewal portal at https://etaotlus.politsei.ee/ekpid/, and it says "The applicant does not meet the citizenship requirements".   As migration advice people take a while to reply, I thought I'd ask here:  Where do I go to renew my temporary residence?  Or, and I hope this isn't the case, were they mistaken by giving me that advice?</p></div>

					<p>Hello dear expats! üëã Today I'm seeking for recommendations, specifically of lawyers/law firms in Estonia who you think you can recommend for A) appeals on (recent sanction-based) residence permit refusal cases and/or B) consultation on ways to legally stay in Estonia in the context of these sanctions. Potential clients are Russian citizens opposed to the Russian aggression against Ukraine (of course - why else would they have moved here?), who are currently living in Estonia based on short-term (1 year, non-renewable) work visa, who work in a large international US and EU-headquartered IT/software company with an office/legal entity in Tallinn. One of them had just recently received a refusal from PPA of their temp residence permit application (on the ground of recently added sanctions in Estonia). Any contacts suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks. ‚úä</p></div>

					<p>People from the UK who moved here before Brexit and still have an Estonian ID-card - how has travel been lately? I somewhat recently went to the UK, and had lots of trouble in Frankfurt as border control were insisting on me having a residence permit and were not accepting the ID card as proof of residency as it is "not a travel document". Myself and my partner are going out of the EU soon and are concerned we'll run into issues again - has anyone applied for the temporary travel document? How does it work? Do you use it instead of your original passport or alongside it?  Or were we just unlucky enough to get annoying border control officers twice and should just wing it? The customer service at border control (PPA) were absolutely useless and just read me text straight off the website.</p></div>

					<p>Hello all. Yesterday the Estonian government has approved restrictions on issuing new residence permits and visas on the ground of work and business in Estonia to Russian and Belarusian citizens. I have a number of colleagues who are still in the process of getting their resident permits issued, and who haven't so far heard a clear answer from the PPA on whether their requests in progress will be cancelled or not. They are already in Estonia, working in the Tallinn office of an international IT company with global presence. Now, the ERR article states that visas and RPs will still be issued on the family and humanitarian grounds. I assume that humanitarian is political asylum? Could someone‚Ä¶ More</p></div>

					<p>Hello groub members, I'm having a concern connected to the helth insurance. I'm going to apply for a type-D visa at the end of this month. It is required a 3-4 months health insurance for my family. However, I'll probably postpone the relocation. So, it means I should buy the new health insurance later. Is there any way to explain the situation to the Embassy that I'm getting a visa, however, I'll relocate later? Maybe you have such experience.</p></div>

					<p>Hi everyone. I have a question regarding the Residence Permit. I have a 5 years temporary residence permit connected to employment but I recently changed my employer (start-up company). - Do I need to notify the Police and Border control department? - Via email is enough to notify them? - Is my current Residence Permit still valid? I would truly appreciate useful responses. Hope everyone has a nice rest of the week.</p></div>

					<p>Hey expats. It is likely the staffers at the various embassies in town are fielding a lot of calls and emails from worried people. If you get a chance, drop them a line to let them know you appreciate them. When we don't have the answers, they find them for us. And with everything going on, they are likely super busy right now. So maybe just say "Hey, thinking of you. Thanks for all the work"</p></div>

					<p>Hi there. I applied for my new residence permit for employment back in December, it's been nearly three months, no answer. Meanwhile, I have a short-term employment registration but as far as I know it's normally valid for three months. I work at a start-up so everything should be okay, I'm just curious why it's taking so long. PPA line is busy, International House has no booking slots. Let's speculate!</p></div>

					<p>Hi Everyone, I am planning to move to Tallinn next month from India for my new job. My employer applied for STER(Short Term Employment Registration) 3+ weeks back. Ideally it takes max 15 working days to get the confirmation but we haven't heard back. My employer has been trying to reach Police and Border Guard Board, without any success.  Has anyone faced such delay regarding STER confirmation? All the (5) people I talked to, who moved recently, got the confirmation within 2 weeks. So, in the worst case, I would like to know did anyone experience rejection/problems regarding STER? Thank you in advance.</p></div>

Technically I am still on a right of temporary residence here and I have had a permanent address in Poland before coming to Estonia... 2. In point 19) "Are you a member of organisations in Estonia or in any other country?" - what organisations do they have in mind? Thanks in advance!</p></div>

					<p>Hello fellow expats! I‚Äôm hoping for some advice..  I am an American citizen and my husband is an EU citizen (with an Estonian ID card). We will eventually move here.  I will be in Estonia for a month in February. While I‚Äôm here I am looking to buy a car. My question is, can I do this without being an EU citizen? (I will obtain an Estonian residency as his spouse but it may not be issued in February). Thank you so much!</p></div>

					<p>Hello there! Any recommendations for a Tallinn based notary who‚Äôd be willing to solemnize a marriage for two foreign nationals residing in Estonia on a TRP basis. The documents are perfectly fine so is the duration of living in Estonia. However, quite a few notaries I‚Äôve reached out to so far seem reluctant to do that without any clear reason and just suggest we contact other notaries.</p></div>

					<p>Happy new year, folks! I have a question, regarding the "residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia". This is basically the residence permit you can get after living/working in Estonia for 3 years and it's not connected to your employment, i.e. you're not required to apply for a new residence permit whenever you change your job. So, has anyone applied for this type of residence permit? If yes, can I please send you a DM with a couple of questions?</p></div>

					<p>Hi to everyone!  I don't know if anyone of you experienced the same but I need to know something.  So I have got a residence permit in 2017 since 2022. And during these 5 years, I couldn't spend 3-4 years in Estonia due to pandemics and other reasons. Now it is going to expire. Can we still apply to extend it? What are the conditions to be able to extend?  Maybe some of you experienced the same. Thank you.</p></div>
